The login was not working, and the system did not return the user information, so I tried again and again until I found the issue. When the sun finally came out, I felt happy because the problem was solved. I closed my computer, told my family the good news, and we all went outside together to enjoy the warm weather."

The screen was showing wrong information because of a missing field, so I checked the code slowly and found the mistake. After I corrected it, the app worked again, and I felt very happy. My family called me to the living room, and we spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing together while the wind continued outside."
