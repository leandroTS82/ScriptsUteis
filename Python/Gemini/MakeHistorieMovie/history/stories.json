      "text": "Hi, I’m sending this message so we can align once you’re back from vacation. Regarding the deletion topic, there are still some open points to be clarified with the business team. However, I thought it would be useful to already prepare a minimal implementation on the technical side. Based on our previous discussions, I created a field in the Zoho test environment called “Verwijderd uit Diefstalmelding” (the name can still be adjusted). This is a boolean field that indicates whether a theft report was deleted by the user. When a theft report is deleted in the portal, this field is set to true. I’m sharing this to initiate the discussion and to validate the expected behavior during development. I will also send a short video demonstrating this working in a local environment. For the demo, I am not using the theft portal UI, but rather Postman and the backend endpoints, purely to illustrate the intended behavior. Let me know your thoughts. Best regards, Leandro"
