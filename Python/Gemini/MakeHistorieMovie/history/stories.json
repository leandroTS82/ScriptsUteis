      "text": "Today I went to the beach and saw some children building sandcastles on the sand. They laughed when a small wave came and took part of the castle away, but they quickly started making new ones. Nearby, a boy gets a surfboard and runs toward the water, excited to catch his first wave. I sat down on the sand to watch everything, feeling relaxed as the day slowly drifted away."

      "text": "The beach is fun! Some people swim in the water. They see who is the fastest. The winner gets a surfboard. Some people lie down on the sand. They want to relax. The kids make sandcastles. They try to make the castles big and tall. Later, the water washes the sandcastles away. The kids make new ones."
