      "text": "Yesterday I took my youngest daughter to the coast of São Paulo, and we brought a blanket for a picnic. She lays out the blanket carefully while I grabbed a banana nut muffin at a nearby bakery. She opened the wrapper, took a big bite, and said it was “crunchy and soft.” Later, we went to feed the ducks with a few bread crumbs, enjoying a simple and peaceful afternoon together."
