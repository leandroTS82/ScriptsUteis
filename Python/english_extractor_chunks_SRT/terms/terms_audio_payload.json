      "The phrase 'I had my mother' is not a common expression in English. It literally means that the speaker possessed or owned their mother, which is not appropriate. The intended meaning might be that the speaker had their mother present or had a relationship with their mother. In everyday English, you would say 'I had my mother with me' or 'I had my mother as my support.'",
      "In other words, the sentence 'I had my mother' suggests that the speaker had their mother in their life or with them, but it's not a standard phrase. You would normally say 'I had my mother with me' or 'I had my mother as my guide.'",
      "A frase 'I had my mother' não é uma expressão comum em inglês. Literalmente significa que o falante possuía ou tinha a mãe, o que não faz sentido. Provavelmente a intenção era dizer que a mãe estava presente ou que o falante tinha a mãe em sua vida. Em inglês, diríamos 'I had my mother with me' ou 'I had my mother as my support'.",
      "Remember: 'to have' is used for possession or relationships, but you don't say 'I had my mother'. Instead, say 'I had my mother with me' or 'my mother was with me'.",
      "I had my mother at the concert last night.",
      "I had my mother by my side when I graduated."
