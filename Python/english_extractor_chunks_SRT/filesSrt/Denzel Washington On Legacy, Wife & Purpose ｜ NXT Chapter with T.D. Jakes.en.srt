1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
I've said it before, [music] you never

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,319
see a U-Haul behind a hearse. You can't

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,480
take it with you.

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,840
>> You know, no matter on your last day, it

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,040
doesn't matter how much money you have.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,400
So that that that you know, the

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
Egyptians [music] tried to take it with

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,599
them.

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
>> Right.

10
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,880
>> Yeah. All they got was Rob. Right.

11
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,920
>> Right. [clears throat] So,

12
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,439
>> hello everybody. I'm TD Jake and I'm

13
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,880
extremely glad to have you here at My

14
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,119
Next Chapter podcast. It is so exciting

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,119
and so fulfilling that you're going to

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,360
listen in today [music] and learn

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,000
something that may change your life or

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,955
change your perspective as I present to

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,320
you none other than the uncomfortable

20
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:44,320
[music] Denzel Washingtons. Today I'm

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,879
joined by a man whose talent has

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,440
inspired [music] generations. An Academy

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,680
Awardwinning actor, director, [music]

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,480
and storyteller. But beyond the

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,640
accolades, Denzel Washington is a man

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,359
anchored in [music] faith, family, and

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,920
service. In this conversation, we talk

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,879
about staying grounded [music] when fame

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,439
and fortune is trying to pull you away

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,400
from what truly matters, why less is

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,360
more, and [music] the power of having a

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,240
strong partner. And he closes with a

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,720
[music] heartfelt prayer that reminds us

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,720
where our strength really comes from.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,439
Chapter one, staying [music] grounded.

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,560
I think there's a whole section of

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,200
people that didn't come to hear me. They

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,200
came to see you.

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:52,240
I'm going to take you back to uh many

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,560
many occasions you and I have been uh in

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,680
conversation. You might not remember

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,799
this. You're having breakfast. I think

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
we were in Atlanta.

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,240
>> Four seasons

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,840
>> at the Four Seasons. He's just sitting

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,680
there having breakfast like people.

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,399
And I came down there to have breakfast.

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,599
I walked past I thought

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,680
is Denzel Washington and we entered into

50
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,080
a conversation

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,040
uh that I sat down and we enjoyed and we

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,800
had great fellowship and great fun and

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,160
you've always been a very touchable

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,959
downto- earthth person who seems to pay

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,800
little attention to all the tremendous

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,879
accolades that have been afforded to

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,480
you.

58
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,360
Is that part of the secret sauce that

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,519
has kept you grounded and added to the

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,560
longevity of your career that you did

61
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,560
not allow the hype to inflate the way

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,360
you see yourself?

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,440
>> My mother uh God rest her soul. She she

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,519
made it to 97.

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,319
She Yeah. She just uh passed this past

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,840
year and she she owned a a beauty shop.

67
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,360
A beauty parlor, excuse me.

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,120
>> Okay. Beauty.

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
>> She owned a beauty parlor. Not a salon.

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,840
A beauty parlor.

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,120
And I had done one or two things and I'm

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
feeling myself.

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
>> Mhm.

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,480
>> And I came in I said, "Ma, did you think

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,239
all of this was going to happen and you

76
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,760
know I was?" She said, "What did you

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,800
say?"

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,120
And [laughter] all the people been

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,000
praying for you. She started calling me

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
superstar.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
>> Uhhuh.

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,879
>> So she said, "Okay, superstar, why don't

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,560
you grab that bucket and go clean them

84
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,879
windows, superstar, when you finish with

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,360
that, superstar?" [laughter] So I I got

86
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,959
the message, you know.

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959
I got the message.

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
>> That grounding is something that's rare

89
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,080
today.

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,360
We see people rise up like zeniths and

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,599
then crash like nuclear bombs. [snorts]

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,799
You have the

93
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:54,799
the added advantage of looking back over

94
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:58,560
decades and decades of being relevant.

95
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,640
Longevity is important to success.

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,959
When you start talking about longevity,

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,120
there are many, many people out here who

98
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,720
want to have longevity regardless of

99
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,159
their profession, whether it is in

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,760
corporate America, whether it's in the

101
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,239
faith realm, whether it's on the stage.

102
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,120
Longevity on the stage. I tell people,

103
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,000
the lights are bright, but the heat is

104
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
hot.

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
>> Yeah. Yeah.

106
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,759
>> Okay. It's been hot.

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,960
It's been hot on that stage. Many many

108
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,400
people who started with you melted.

109
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,120
>> How did you make it?

110
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,479
>> How do I what?

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,400
>> How did you make it?

112
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,000
>> By the grace of God. I mean, I don't

113
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,240
take any credit for it. It's it's

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,400
nothing I did uh as special, you know, u

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,919
been knocked down a few pegs and and and

116
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,800
recognized it. But um I just didn't put

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,960
me first. I just put God first. and uh

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,040
he's carried me [clears throat] through

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,560
the ups and the many downs, you know,

120
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,840
the things you hear about and the things

121
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,800
you don't hear about.

122
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,720
>> Mhm. Uh

123
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,800
>> you know when you think about that uh we

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,039
were at Taliperry Studios for the

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,680
dedication of the Taliperry Studios and

126
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,520
we were talking uh the the Sunday

127
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
morning I spoke I talked about the

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,360
difference between people who walk

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,600
through a door which is an opportunity

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,440
and other people who turn that door into

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
a platform

132
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,440
>> through which other people are able to

133
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,919
access their dreams Without question,

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,880
you have had many doors open to you. But

135
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,160
you have also created many platforms and

136
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,479
introduced to the world many many uh

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,120
talented gifted people without which

138
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,600
your influence would not have happened.

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,600
You didn't have to go that extra mile to

140
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,880
do that. You could have enjoyed the

141
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,400
limelight of the door and walked away.

142
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,280
Is there a sense of fulfillment that you

143
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,320
get out of creating that platform or is

144
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,280
it purely from a business perspective?

145
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,600
>> I I love

146
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,120
seeing other people do well. Always

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,840
have.

148
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,560
I I grew up in the in the in the boys

149
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,919
club, now the boys and girls club. And I

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,639
was a counselor there. And I I I I I you

151
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,080
know I I I came up in the club as a coun

152
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,479
that at first as a camper and then as a

153
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,000
counselor and I always enjoyed seeing

154
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,080
other people do well. It's it's

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,919
interesting that I I ended up in this

156
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,000
business where it appears that you're

157
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,840
out front. That's that's not even my

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,840
nature actually.

159
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,160
>> You know, the funny thing about it is

160
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,440
when you think about when when the

161
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
public thinks about you, they think of

162
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,759
you as an actor. When I think about you,

163
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,039
I think I think about you not only as an

164
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,440
actor, an entertainer, not only as an

165
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,280
icon in our community, but I also see

166
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,039
you as a businessman. Because what the

167
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,840
public doesn't realize is that

168
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,160
entertainment is a business. And you

169
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,960
have been successful not only at acting

170
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,360
on screen, which a lot of people do. You

171
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,599
have been successful at the business of

172
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
entertainment. Can you talk to me about

173
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,639
the business aspect?

174
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,319
>> I tell people all the time, they call a

175
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,880
show business. They should call it

176
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,280
business show. [laughter]

177
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,919
No business, no next show.

178
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,039
>> Absolutely

179
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,680
>> simple as that.

180
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,639
>> Explain it.

181
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,639
>> No, no, no business, no no next show.

182
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,240
And you know, you have to deliver. I

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,599
mean, it is a business. It's a dollars

184
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,240
and cents business. Uh, and you have to

185
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,880
deliver

186
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,639
>> and you have to know your worth and you

187
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,800
have to be able to negotiate from the

188
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,880
perspective of knowing your own value.

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,880
If other people know the value to want

190
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,599
you, but you don't know the value to

191
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,440
know who you are yourself, it's it would

192
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,039
appear to me it would be quite difficult

193
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,680
to be successful if you don't at least

194
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,440
have some sense of the equity that has

195
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,479
accured behind your brand and

196
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,599
consequently negotiate from the leverage

197
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,039
of understanding that equity. At what

198
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,919
point did it hit you that I am worth

199
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,440
more than how I'm being handled? And how

200
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:08,479
did you negotiate into the next stream

201
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,840
of opportunities without allowing people

202
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,400
to prostitute what God had given you?

203
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,080
>> I I'm just not

204
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,840
I'm just that guy, you know. I'm not

205
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,759
scared to say no, you know, and you have

206
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,000
to say no sometimes, you know. And uh

207
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,599
it's it's the nose that I've said that

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,080
have really gotten me, you know, I don't

209
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:36,560
know, wherever I am now professionally.

210
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,839
And the the money really didn't scare

211
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,680
me.

212
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,200
>> You know,

213
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,519
I've said it before, you never see a

214
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,920
U-Haul behind a hearse. You can't take

215
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,160
it with you. [laughter]

216
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,440
>> You know, no matter on your last day, it

217
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
doesn't matter how much money you have.

218
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
So that that that you know the Egyptians

219
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
tried to take it with them. [laughter]

220
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
>> Right.

221
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,360
>> Yeah. All they got was Rob. Right.

222
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,880
>> Right.

223
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,279
>> So So you you but you can leave it here.

224
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
>> Yeah.

225
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,279
>> And I'm not just talking about the

226
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,320
money. I'm talking about what God has

227
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,519
blessed me with. I can I can leave here,

228
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,399
you know, and and that's that's what's

229
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,399
important to me is to at this point in

230
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,519
my life just to be in that number.

231
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,320
>> You you uh appear on a lot of platforms.

232
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,760
the uh professor when he inter president

233
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,080
of the college when he introduced you

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,480
beginning to talk about you started on

235
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,800
stage not too long ago my wife and I

236
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,080
flew up to New York and saw you on stage

237
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,120
>> nice man coming

238
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,441
>> uh Caesar

239
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,096
>> oh Julia Caesar Julius 15 years ago

240
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,160
[clears throat]

241
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:37,279
[laughter]

242
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,240
>> seven years ago

243
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,399
>> time flies time flies

244
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,680
>> that was just the other day to me now

245
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,839
that's a blur you you walked out on that

246
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,519
stage and you were back at home again,

247
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,560
back where you started from. Number one,

248
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,080
what made you go back to the stage and

249
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,760
did it did was it nostalgic for you to

250
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,839
be on that stage?

251
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
more than that or as much as that is

252
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,959
it's the foundation I had to get back to

253
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,811
the you know like here on stage the

254
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,120
audience will tell you that night right

255
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:13,600
[laughter]

256
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,920
how they feel about you and and and and

257
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,079
you know it's a humbling experience and

258
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,000
I just wanted to get back to the to you

259
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,880
to the to the foundation between 1990

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,519
and 2005 I was doing the best I could to

261
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,320
help my wife to raise our kids and they

262
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,200
were at an age where I couldn't leave

263
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,480
California for weeks at a time, you

264
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,160
know, cuz you can't commute when you

265
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,120
when you're doing a show on Broadway.

266
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,680
So, I just chose not to do to do any

267
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,800
plays on Broadway for about 15 years.

268
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:50,240
>> Chapter two, less is more.

269
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,480
>> When I saw you uh in the car getting

270
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,959
ready to leave the hotel in New Orleans,

271
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,040
I think you were shooting Safe Room.

272
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:05,760
>> Safe House. safe house at the time.

273
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:10,560
To me, that was an amazing uh movie

274
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,360
largely because of the scenes that had

275
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,839
no words.

276
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,839
>> My view, the greatest actors I have ever

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:22,399
seen are people who can convey messages

278
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,839
without script.

279
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,800
And you are absolutely

280
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,360
amazing at conveying

281
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,120
>> an emotion. Thank you.

282
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,959
>> You know, people don't understand the

283
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
hardest thing to do as an actor is to

284
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,238
listen.

285
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,560
>> Hardest thing to do as a human being

286
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:44,160
[laughter] is

287
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,000
to listen. So, and to be quiet and

288
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,279
actually not do a whole lot, right?

289
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,399
>> You know, we think, "Oh, the camera's

290
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
on. I got to

291
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,160
>> Yeah. Yeah.

292
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
>> act it up." Less is actually more. Less

293
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
is actually more.

294
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,120
>> Less is more.

295
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
>> Please write that down because

296
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,600
>> less is more.

297
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,440
>> One of the big mistakes that I think

298
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:05,279
that church uh actors make is that they

299
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,880
go overboard. The real pros understand

300
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,880
that less is more.

301
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,440
>> If it feels good to you, it probably

302
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,279
isn't any good.

303
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,200
>> That's the truth. If you if you feeling

304
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,079
so good about yourself, then you're too

305
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,240
self-aware.

306
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,160
>> Yeah. So, you're probably not as good as

307
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,639
you think cuz you too busy thinking,

308
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,453
"Oh, look at yeah, I'm acting now."

309
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,453
>> Yeah. [laughter]

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,920
That's That's funny. And it shows. It

311
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,240
shows it shows to the audience. Uh I I'm

312
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,959
sitting there screaming at the TV set

313
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,160
because I was just mesmerized. In fact,

314
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,399
I teased you about it. Uh uh I told you

315
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,320
that you died so well that I was ready

316
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,120
to commit your body to the ground and

317
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,639
that's

318
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,279
>> which in in safe house.

319
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,440
>> Yes.

320
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,240
>> You know what? That's my favorite death

321
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,680
of mine.

322
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,200
>> Y you died big brother. You died

323
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,480
>> that that and training day. Those are

324
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
two of my favorite deaths. I

325
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,360
>> I started saying ashes [laughter] to

326
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,920
ashes for as much as the brother was

327
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,040
dead. Okay. This guy died for like five

328
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,959
minutes. He just he just died. I seen

329
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,000
people die all the time. I thought he

330
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,959
was dead. I got my robe. [laughter]

331
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,279
I got my sash and I started for as much

332
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,079
sin as a dearly departed brother's pass

333
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,839
from death. He was gone. And you said to

334
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,519
me at the time, you said I died too

335
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,200
well. Now they're trying to do a sequel

336
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,680
and they can't get me. That's right.

337
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,360
>> And we laughed about it and we talked

338
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,200
about it. It was it was an amazing

339
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:42,079
thing. Uh when you you uh when you think

340
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,344
of Antoine Fischer, you introduced

341
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,364
>> Thank you. [cheering]

342
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,364
[applause]

343
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,320
>> What was amazing, not not only did you

344
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:56,720
uh you produced it, you directed it,

345
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,760
you brought new talent to the stage that

346
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,760
we had not known. I think he delivered

347
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,040
one of his greatest performances up

348
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,240
under your

349
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
>> talking about Derek. Derek Luke.

350
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,480
>> Derek Luke.

351
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,160
>> And people don't realize a young woman

352
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
in there by the name of Viola Davis.

353
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
>> I listen I was coming back.

354
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,959
>> Oh, you was getting there. I'm sorry.

355
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,880
>> Yeah. Yeah. I Yeah, I realized Viola

356
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,600
Davis got her start playing his mother.

357
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,920
She plays her his mother in a scene in

358
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
that

359
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,120
>> No lines.

360
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,480
>> No lines. No lines. But

361
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
>> no, she has one line. You want something

362
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,279
to eat?

363
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,399
>> Yeah.

364
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,760
>> That's all she says. You want something

365
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,760
to eat?

366
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:33,360
But can't nobody out cry Vape. Listen,

367
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,880
baby girl can cry until she can cry till

368
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,600
I start crying. I don't even know what

369
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,519
I'm crying about.

370
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,480
How How did you cast those two

371
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,240
unheard of people and then direct them

372
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,079
in a way that you got the best out of

373
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,880
them? Because now the reason I asked

374
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,360
this question whether you are in film or

375
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,839
interested in entertainment this is

376
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,480
really about how do you get the best out

377
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,120
of the people you choose in the

378
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,079
positions you hold. So don't just listen

379
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,040
from an entertaining aspect but from an

380
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,440
informational aspect to understand how

381
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,639
do you choose people who are going to

382
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,320
play a role in your organization. A and

383
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,720
B how do you get the best out of them

384
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,079
should help every leader every pastor

385
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,240
every manager every entrepreneur in this

386
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,399
room because some of the time we suffer

387
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,800
because we got the wrong cast we hired

388
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,399
the wrong people. Some of the times we

389
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,600
suffer because we had the right people,

390
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,160
but we lack the ability to get the best

391
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,959
out of them. You have to do both of them

392
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,480
in order to be successful. Teach us how

393
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,480
to do that. Get out of the way.

394
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,800
It's hard. That's that's easy to say,

395
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,040
but hard to do.

396
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,959
>> I can't play the part. Derek played the

397
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,079
part. Biola played the part. Sometime we

398
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,199
want to we want to do it all. Get out of

399
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,320
the way, you know.

400
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,880
Get out of the way.

401
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,206
>> That's a modest answer. It's a I'm not

402
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,199
going to let you off that easy. Okay,

403
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:04,639
[laughter]

404
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,320
because anybody can get out of the way.

405
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,240
We We can get out of the way. We can get

406
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,720
out of the way. I understand that you

407
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,240
are saying not to try to make the actor

408
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,120
be you, but that ignores the fact that

409
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,560
you had to select somebody who had that

410
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,600
thing in them. How do you look at

411
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,680
someone and see in them things that has

412
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,279
yet to be unearthed out of them?

413
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,480
>> When I'm casting, I always tell the

414
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,720
casting people, I I only need one. I

415
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,759
only needed one Viola Davis. I didn't

416
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,000
need 10.

417
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,560
>> So, and I know it when I see it.

418
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,639
>> Mhm.

419
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,920
>> And I and and I know it when I haven't

420
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,720
seen it.

421
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,639
>> So, when it walks in in the room, then

422
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,759
when she walked in the room, I knew. So,

423
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,880
and I knew. So, it's a gut thing. It's a

424
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,040
It's a instinct thing more than I look

425
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,600
for this, this, this, and this. There's

426
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,759
just

427
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,880
>> Yeah. It's not a checklist. Okay. It's

428
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,800
not a checklist.

429
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,480
You know, I think I know what good

430
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,439
acting is.

431
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,199
>> Yeah. You got to [laughter] know what

432
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,959
good acting is. You got to know what

433
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,640
you're looking for, which is a note

434
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
worth taking. You got to know what

435
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,640
you're looking for because I think a lot

436
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,559
of times we don't know what we're

437
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,640
looking for. We interview people, but we

438
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,240
we know the job description. We know the

439
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,120
title, but we don't know the

440
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,919
temperament, the talent, and how well

441
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,240
they will fit into the continuity of our

442
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,000
organization. So, we hire people who

443
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,440
have the right education, but they are

444
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,960
toxic in the organization.

445
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,720
Are you hearing what I'm saying? You

446
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
have to know what the temperament is

447
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,640
that you're looking for. Again, you'll

448
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,280
know it when you see it. But whether you

449
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,559
know it or not, you are casting in your

450
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,360
office, in your church, in your choir,

451
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,200
uh in your leadership, you c anybody can

452
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,200
come in the congregation. I don't care.

453
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,120
But whoever is going to be on the team,

454
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,240
I already know what temperament of

455
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,200
person I need in that team. And I'm not

456
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,960
just looking at their bio. I'm looking

457
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,679
at their body language, their

458
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,640
personality, their work ethic, how their

459
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,440
how how congenial they are with people,

460
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,400
how sensitive they are. I don't need a

461
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,480
drama queen running a conference. I

462
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,720
don't need you creating problems. I need

463
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,720
you solving problems. And so I can

464
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,039
clearly delineate what I'm looking for

465
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,960
in the individual. He has a list of

466
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,679
criterias that he's saying that he has

467
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,840
to that he knows in his head that he's

468
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,760
looking for in the actor and that he

469
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,039
will know it when he sees it. You cannot

470
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:41,360
regulate that over to somebody else.

471
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,840
>> Nelson Mandela said, "A leader

472
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,000
like a shepherd

473
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,200
sends the fast, nimble sheep out front

474
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
so that the rest will follow."

475
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,520
not realizing they're all being led from

476
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,039
behind.

477
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,480
So, a leader leads quietly from behind,

478
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,320
>> you know, you don't have to jump out

479
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,480
front and I don't have to out act

480
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,600
everybody and I, you know, we want to we

481
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,919
want to do it all.

482
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
>> Yeah.

483
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,240
>> Well, get out the way. Let me show you.

484
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,679
You know, but

485
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,640
that was pretty good advice from Mr.

486
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,200
Mandela.

487
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,480
>> Yeah. Yeah. I would think so. [laughter]

488
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,919
I would think so.

489
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,919
>> Chapter three, faith.

490
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:26,240
>> [music]

491
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:30,400
>> When you start thinking about uh

492
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:34,160
August Wilson, the body of his work, the

493
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,960
magnitude of his impact on the Broadway

494
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,160
stage, off Broadway stage at a time that

495
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,559
black people were not being recognized,

496
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:48,240
the body of his work ended up in your

497
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,480
hands of which fences is one deposit.

498
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,400
What made you make Yeah. Yeah. Give it

499
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,039
up for fences.

500
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,480
Um, [applause]

501
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,039
what made you make the decision to buy

502
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,080
the body of his work or to own the body?

503
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,799
>> The family came to me.

504
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,400
>> The family came.

505
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:10,799
>> Yeah. His his his uh widow uh uh

506
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,760
Castanza said the we'd like you to take

507
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,440
care of August plays for us and make

508
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,480
films. I said, I'm just the man for the

509
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,720
job, you know. So that's that's what I'm

510
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,360
doing.

511
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,919
>> What made you give that answer?

512
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,919
>> Because it's the truth. [laughter]

513
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,880
>> What did somebody say was said, "You're

514
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,469
not conceited. You convinced, huh?"

515
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,469
>> Yeah. [laughter]

516
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,559
>> It's the I mean, I'm not bragging. I

517
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,000
mean, I was the right one at the in the

518
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,159
right place at the right time with the

519
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,440
right power in the right position to get

520
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,080
things done,

521
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,120
>> you know. And

522
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,400
>> And you got them done.

523
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,360
>> I'm I'm getting them done. I'm getting

524
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,200
them done with the

525
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,600
>> one by one. you getting them done and

526
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,120
then what made you make the decision to

527
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,760
keep so much of his original cast and

528
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,640
take them from the stage to the screen?

529
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,280
These are decisions. What I'm asking him

530
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,600
is how do you make decisions? Because

531
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,840
that has a lot to do with defining the

532
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,799
success of your leadership. How do you

533
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,120
make decisions? And some people hold

534
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,039
positions but delegate decisions.

535
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,080
>> Say that again. Some people hold

536
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,720
positions but delegate decisions.

537
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,520
>> Okay?

538
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,400
>> And while I want everybody's input into

539
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,840
the decision, my style of leadership,

540
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,000
the final decision is going to be mine.

541
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,240
>> Okay? I welcome your input. I'm not a

542
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,480
dictator. I want to hear your input and

543
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,840
I will adjust my decision if your

544
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,000
information shifts the outcome. But at

545
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,919
the end of the day, I don't want people

546
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,600
making decisions that I have to live

547
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,039
with.

548
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,640
Because at the end of the day, it's not

549
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,360
going to be your name in the paper. It's

550
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
going to be mine.

551
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
>> That's correct.

552
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,159
>> And I want to know.

553
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,200
>> That's correct.

554
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,760
>> Am I right about it?

555
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,880
>> Yes, you are.

556
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,120
>> They're not going to write about your

557
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,799
staff. They're going to write about you.

558
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,159
>> And they're not going to attack your

559
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,440
staff. They're going to attack you. They

560
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,440
don't know the name of your staff.

561
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,840
They're going to come after you. And so

562
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,000
you you want to be in you want to hire

563
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,480
people that are smart enough that they

564
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,360
bring you brilliant ideas. But you have

565
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,559
to decide, are those brilliant ideas

566
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,679
worth the consequences of those ideas?

567
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:21,120
In my world, that's how I do it. In your

568
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:24,400
world, what made you make the decision

569
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,280
to keep these people who had never been

570
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,440
on screen as far as I know, had always

571
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,600
been on stage, and yet you brought them

572
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,360
on stage. And then I'm going to tell you

573
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,640
what they told me about you.

574
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,640
>> You talking about fences now?

575
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,640
>> Fences. films too.

576
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,600
>> Well, because they were great actors.

577
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,360
Viola Davis, Steven McKenley Henderson,

578
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,679
Michael T. W. They they were all great

579
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,840
actors and and I'm loyal, you know. We

580
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,440
we we got the success that we had on

581
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,320
stage together. Why should I Now, now we

582
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,520
had to we had to recast a little girl.

583
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,600
Uh uh cuz she she uh you know and and uh

584
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,559
and one other part because the kid grew

585
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,685
up

586
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,080
>> but uh

587
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:06,960
[laughter]

588
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,480
>> they do that.

589
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,520
>> Yeah, they do that. They got it. Funny

590
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,545
how that works. And

591
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,360
>> yeah, it is relieving actually.

592
00:23:12,545 --> 00:23:16,720
[laughter]

593
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:21,679
>> They keep coming back though.

594
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:24,080
>> Mine are here so I won't comment. Now uh

595
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,760
you brought them to the stage. I

596
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,400
interviewed them while I was doing a

597
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,360
talk show in Hollywood. This is what

598
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,600
they told me about you. They told me

599
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:40,240
that you were as much a director,

600
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:43,039
producer as you were a pastor.

601
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,600
They said you started every morning Oh,

602
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,320
yeah. Of course.

603
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,679
>> With prayer.

604
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,480
>> Right.

605
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,600
They said they were spiritually enriched

606
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,280
up under your leadership because of your

607
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,086
consciousness of God.

608
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,106
>> Well,

609
00:23:57,086 --> 00:23:59,106
[applause]

610
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,381
thank you. [laughter]

611
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,440
>> I now look, I've been on the set a few

612
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,840
times myself. Not nearly nearly nearly

613
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,559
nearly what you've done, but it is not

614
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,520
normal to start the day with prayer.

615
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,279
>> It's not.

616
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,200
>> No. I I didn't hear what you said.

617
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,840
>> It's not normal to start the day with

618
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,520
prayer.

619
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,640
>> Well, I don't know what other people do,

620
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,720
but

621
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,240
>> I mean on the set, I'm not talking about

622
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,799
in your personal life.

623
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,880
>> To have the boldness of faith to bring a

624
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,640
crew together and say, "Let's pray

625
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,640
before we start."

626
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,039
>> I've not seen a lot of people do that in

627
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,200
Hollywood.

628
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,640
>> Or where are we? What town we in? Or in

629
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,159
Charlotte for that. You know, it's

630
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,440
funny. It's funny. People talk about

631
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,679
Hollywood

632
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,360
>> like it's a place where evil things

633
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,279
happen.

634
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,120
>> Los Angeles is a city.

635
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,520
>> There's no place called Hollywood. We

636
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,960
don't all get together and and have

637
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,760
Hollywood meetings and

638
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,080
>> Yeah.

639
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,840
>> Hollywood is a street in Los Angeles.

640
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm in the movie business, right?

641
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,880
>> I'm not in the Hollywood. I don't even

642
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
know what the Hollywood business is,

643
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
right?

644
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,000
>> I don't know how to how to do that. I

645
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,640
make movies. I do plays. I direct. And I

646
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,720
that's

647
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,360
>> that being said and that is absolutely

648
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,320
true and I I I've been on both sides of

649
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,559
the street. I don't demonize what is

650
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,200
called quote unquote Hollywood. I'm just

651
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,440
saying in the course of doing business

652
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,400
not every person in business brings the

653
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,720
cast together and has prayer

654
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,679
>> that doesn't happen. Why does that

655
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,360
happen with you?

656
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,240
Because I was raised, right? I don't

657
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,080
know [laughter] that this,

658
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,520
>> you know. My father was a minister.

659
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,480
>> I know your father was a minister.

660
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,000
>> Father was a minister.

661
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,000
>> He's a PK. Y'all give it up. PK's

662
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,720
>> Church of God in Christ.

663
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,840
>> Church of God in Christ.

664
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,159
>> My mother grew up in uh well,

665
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,279
folks not old enough. Kelly Temple in in

666
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,279
in New York City.

667
00:25:58,262 --> 00:26:02,080
>> [laughter]

668
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,039
>> Okay. My mother grew up in in in that

669
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,159
church and uh

670
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,640
>> see you at home.

671
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:10,080
>> I see. [laughter]

672
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,480
>> Evidently being raised in the faith, you

673
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,520
still are involved in the faith. You

674
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,440
still have been a a loyal supporter of

675
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,080
West Angeles. You've done some amazing

676
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,159
things down through the years. You uh

677
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,960
have helped Bishop Blake in amazing

678
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,760
ways. You have helped many people start

679
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,640
and launch their careers. You have

680
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,440
financed uh historically black colleges.

681
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,279
You have been extremely philanthropic.

682
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,400
You have a different rhythm

683
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,279
in your soul. Is that coming from your

684
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,360
faith?

685
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,320
>> That's sad that you say that have to

686
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,320
even say that because that's what we all

687
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,799
should should do.

688
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,000
>> Yeah.

689
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,120
>> It shouldn't be. There's nothing

690
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,640
exceptional about

691
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,919
>> should

692
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,120
should [laughter]

693
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,520
emphasis on the word should. But but you

694
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,400
know without sitting here talking to me

695
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,440
that that is exceptional that very few

696
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,360
people have the kind of temperament

697
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,440
especially that lasts that long and

698
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,080
started that young. We have not seen

699
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,159
you. We seen you do sexy scenes but we

700
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,799
have not seen your body. You have not

701
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,080
prostituted yourself in any film at any

702
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,240
time. Oh, you haven't seen all the

703
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,360
movies and you ain't seen a couple of

704
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,520
them you ain't seen.

705
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,760
>> I saw you down to your draws, but I

706
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,440
don't recall.

707
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,880
>> Okay, let's let's keep it real.

708
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,520
>> I did a little bumping and grinding. I

709
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
did a little

710
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,720
>> Yeah. Yeah, you did a little bumping and

711
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,279
grinding, but you never you you you

712
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,480
Yeah,

713
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,600
>> that's terrible.

714
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,520
>> Yeah, that's edit this out the tape. But

715
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,640
we going to keep it real for a minute.

716
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,120
You didn't put your

717
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,080
everything out there, [laughter] let me

718
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,559
say it like that,

719
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,000
>> right?

720
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,880
>> To get a role. Why didn't you? And are

721
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,919
you glad you did?

722
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,760
>> I had a mentor uh uh in in college my

723
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,880
senior year when I really just started

724
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,520
acting. And and he talked he talked to

725
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,360
me about never having to compromise,

726
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:10,799
you know, myself. and and and and

727
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,960
I remembered that that that wasn't

728
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:17,760
necessary and I I got that guy. I mean,

729
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,760
I I've just been blessed beyond measure.

730
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,880
I found out early in college that I had

731
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,720
this unique ability. So, and things that

732
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,159
were happening in in my life. Uh, I

733
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,760
don't know if some people maybe have

734
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,320
heard me talk about a woman prophesied

735
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,679
when I was 20 years old. She said, "Boy,

736
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,159
you're going to travel the world and

737
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,279
preach to millions of people." She

738
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,080
didn't say, "You're going to be famous."

739
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,279
She didn't say, "You're going to win

740
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,559
Oscars." She didn't say any of those

741
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,080
things. She said, "You know, you are

742
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,480
going to try." By the way, I was

743
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,480
flunking out of college. I had a 1.7

744
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,080
gradepoint average. I was in my mother's

745
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,760
beauty shop. And the reason I was in her

746
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,159
beauty shop was because I was not in

747
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,320
school. I was not in school that

748
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,840
semester. And this woman, Miss Ruth

749
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,520
Green,

750
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,520
uh had this prophecy that that

751
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,640
is coming true.

752
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,200
>> Uh-huh.

753
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,080
>> Well,

754
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,919
>> it's coming true.

755
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,880
>> It's coming true.

756
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,880
I talked to you on the phone

757
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,080
and I told you that I believe that you

758
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,600
have something down inside of you beyond

759
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,960
acting

760
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,960
from a spiritual perspective that is

761
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,200
awakening.

762
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,120
Uh if you agree with that, tell us what

763
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,360
that feels like. And that has shown up

764
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,960
in your work. It has shown up off

765
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,679
camera.

766
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,600
What is evolving in you now from a

767
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,640
spiritual perspective?

768
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,559
>> It it's just that it's evolving. You

769
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,399
know, I uh I remember talking to uh

770
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,520
Bishop Blake years ago. I said, "Well,

771
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,039
you know, what do you do? Should I

772
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,600
should I become a preacher? Should I?"

773
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,840
He said, "No, no, you you have your pull

774
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,880
pit,

775
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,840
>> you know, and and and use it."

776
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,799
>> So, I do have a Everybody talks about a

777
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,165
platform. I got a pretty I guess big

778
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,080
platform or whatever you call it.

779
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:09,120
[laughter]

780
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,360
>> He got a pretty big

781
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,720
>> Yeah. So I try to try to use it for

782
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,080
good.

783
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,045
>> Use it for good.

784
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,045
>> Use it for good. [applause]

785
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,360
>> Chapter [music] four. A great wife.

Warren Buffett says that if a man toward

787
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:36,480
the autumn of his life and this is poor

788
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:39,840
quote of it but pretty close uh has

789
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,880
still maintained the respect

790
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,640
and love of the people who matter most.

791
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:50,399
He is a successful man.

792
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,039
You live and work in an industry where

793
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,880
the falling apart of the home is the

794
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:59,679
headlines of the week and people swip

795
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,039
and swap in relationships all the time.

796
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,480
It is a very difficult thing to be who

797
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,840
you are and still be a father and still

798
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,760
be a husband and yet somehow you have

799
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,200
been graced

800
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,240
that the people who matter most

801
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,399
still respect you.

802
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,600
Tell us how.

803
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,600
>> I have a great wife.

804
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:29,751
[cheering]

805
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:29,751
>> [laughter]

806
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:35,591
[cheering]

807
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,159
>> That's the answer.

808
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:37,200
[applause]

809
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,840
>> Listen, bro.

810
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:46,159
>> That I have a great great Listen, my

811
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,760
wife is from right here, North Carolina.

812
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,320
>> She was a child prodigy. Mhm.

813
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,159
>> She was the Van Clber competitor, one of

814
00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:00,559
the world's best young pianists at at 9

815
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,399
years old. She was the first black woman

816
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,399
that was supposed to be Miss North

817
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,760
Carolina at a time when they couldn't

818
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,840
let a black person be she she had gotten

819
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,360
whatever Miss Runner up or first runner.

820
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,480
They couldn't even let her be first

821
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,799
runner up because the if Miss North

822
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,360
Carolina fell out, she couldn't go to

823
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,679
all the places

824
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,559
in this state.

825
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,279
>> That Wow.

826
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,320
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, her father was an

827
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,120
educator. Uh uh uh they had the one of

828
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,600
the top This was back in segregation

829
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,159
before integration. They had one of the

830
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,000
top schools in North Carolina, the top

831
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,600
debating team. One of the best schools

832
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,519
in North Carolina was an all black

833
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,080
school uh from Newton, North Carolina.

834
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,200
>> Wow.

835
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,720
>> Yeah.

836
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,880
>> I I think that's such a great answer.

837
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,799
It's one that I can really relate to.

838
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,919
Having a great wife has a lot to do with

839
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,919
whether you make it through the store.

840
00:32:55,502 --> 00:33:01,480
[applause]

841
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,480
And it's always nice when she's cute,

842
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,000
but it's not nice when she's cute and

843
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,000
not great.

844
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:11,877
>> [cheering]

845
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,897
>> got a witness somewhere in there.

846
00:33:11,877 --> 00:33:13,897
[laughter]

847
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,679
>> So, a word up to the fellas. A lot of

848
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,679
times you have more emphasis on cute

849
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,519
than great.

850
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,679
>> But what makes the relationship

851
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:29,679
sustainable is great rather than cute.

852
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,399
And I think that one of the problems

853
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,360
that we have with longevity

854
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,360
is that it is expensive to be a great

855
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,360
woman.

856
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:45,039
>> [applause]

857
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:49,840
>> In a world where women spend billions of

858
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:54,240
dollars looking cute,

859
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:57,600
>> it is more expensive to be a great woman

860
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,519
because a great woman absorbs a lot of

861
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,840
shock,

862
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,919
a lot of sorrow,

863
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,679
>> a lot of pain.

864
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,000
A great woman bites her tongue.

865
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,879
at times that other women speak their

866
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,240
mind. It is expensive to be a great

867
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:19,520
woman to know when to speak and when to

868
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,520
shut up and go the other way. A lot of

869
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,639
women who started clapping when he said

870
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,359
that you had to really do inventory. Is

871
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,200
he talking about you? Because because

872
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,440
because

873
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,919
I really do think a lot of the credit

874
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,079
goes to holding things together. It's

875
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:40,000
unfair. is probably not right, but it

876
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:42,480
still is true to having a great woman.

877
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,599
We come up sometimes and get the bow,

878
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,760
but really the woman is the glue. At

879
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:53,200
least in my house, Serena is the glue.

880
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:57,119
She is the glue and the staples and the

881
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:01,280
safety pins and the stitches

882
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,160
and everything else. I kid you not. I

883
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,880
kid you not.

884
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,079
>> My My wife

885
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,640
My wife is consistent.

886
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,599
>> Uhhuh. Yes. Consistent.

887
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,240
>> Consistent. She made breakfast every

888
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,560
morning.

889
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,880
>> Yeah.

890
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,440
>> For the children. They they had a little

891
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,880
Bible study every morning. She drove

892
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,240
them to school

893
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,079
>> every morning. So she when I was out

894
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,599
running making the movies and, you know,

895
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,160
killing the lion and bringing the meat

896
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,480
home, hey, cook that. [laughter]

897
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,760
Yeah. Yeah. Cook that. you know, but she

898
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,599
was doing the

899
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,599
>> It might be our generation, but I could

900
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,680
say that I could take your statement and

901
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,599
put it right on Serita, having prayer

902
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,160
with the kids every morning, making sure

903
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,320
everybody got something to eat and still

904
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,079
doing her day and still doing her thing

905
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,240
and still building her business and

906
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,320
still went back and got her degree and

907
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,960
still supportive of me and still got her

908
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,720
hair done. You You have to be a bad

909
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,599
woman to be a great woman.

910
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:04,480
Multi-talented. In fact, a great woman

911
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:07,920
is a corporation in one person. She is a

912
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,040
corporation all by herself. If you are a

913
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,359
great woman, you are a corporation.

914
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,400
Whether you start a business or not, you

915
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,640
are a complete corporation. Give

916
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
yourselves a hand. if you think you're a

917
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,800
great woman.

918
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,760
>> And and and [applause and cheering] let

919
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,720
let me say this to the to the guys for

920
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,720
the the guys out there. You got to have

921
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
vision

922
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,200
to see potential

923
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,880
instead of well, it ain't working right

924
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,760
now. Let me go over here, right?

925
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,800
>> Let me go over here. Let me go over

926
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:47,375
here. You know,

927
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,119
>> I hucked my wife's pedigree.

928
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:53,520
>> [laughter]

929
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,520
>> Come on. Her her pedigree, you know, she

930
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,280
she raised me up out the ghetto a little

931
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,480
bit. You know, I had one foot in this in

932
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,640
the street.

933
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,200
>> You know, so it's a balance. It's a

934
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,880
balance.

935
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,960
>> Tell the truth, shame the devil. I'm

936
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,640
with you. [laughter]

937
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,440
>> I was throwing rocks at the penitentiary

938
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,920
now.

939
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,960
>> Yeah.

940
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,400
>> No question.

941
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,960
>> The the thing about it is

942
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,480
at different stages of life, you raise

943
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,359
each other.

944
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,599
Right. Right. Right.

945
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,480
>> At different stages of life, you parent

946
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,400
your partner

947
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,720
>> depending on what is going on at that

948
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,800
particular moment. And people have given

949
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,640
up on parenting their partner because it

950
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,000
has become

951
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,120
uh popular to replace

952
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,140
>> rather than to develop.

953
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,140
[cheering]

954
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,320
>> Chapter five, get out of the way.

955
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:48,400
>> [music]

956
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,760
>> How much

957
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,160
of who you are affects what you do? Let

958
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:59,040
me say it like that.

959
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,960
>> I don't know. I mean, I I don't examine

960
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,599
myself.

961
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,480
>> Really?

962
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,920
>> No. No. I don't you know, I know where I

963
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,200
got it from. I know what I'm supposed to

964
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,160
do with it, and that's good enough for

965
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,960
me. I don't I don't keep notes or you

966
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,560
know talk to myself and

967
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,359
too too much about I try to get out of

968
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,160
the way.

969
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,359
>> You try to get out

970
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,320
>> I try to get out of the way. Yeah. You

971
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,520
know uh man man goes down to the ocean.

972
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,079
>> Okay.

973
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:29,599
>> Tries to fit all the knowledge of the

974
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,839
ocean into his little brain

975
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,599
instead of just jumping in the water

976
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,480
>> and enjoying himself. Faith is jumping

977
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,119
in the water. Mhm.

978
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,000
>> Ego is if I don't understand it, it

979
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,560
doesn't exist. To think we can reduce

980
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,040
everything to our level of understanding

981
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:52,320
is ego on steroid. How dare any of us? I

982
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,440
know what's best. Oh, really? Okay. Good

983
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,040
luck. [laughter]

984
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,680
>> Yeah. You know, three times since we've

985
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,720
been talking, you have said get out of

986
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,920
the way.

987
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,960
>> Oh, yeah. Okay. And and and if I had to

988
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,359
entitle this this this talk, this master

989
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,280
class, I would have to call it get out

990
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,599
of the way.

991
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,640
>> And and that is so simple and yet so

992
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,800
profound and yet so difficult to do

993
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,720
because often we worship at the shrine

994
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,577
of our own point of view.

995
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,320
>> Say that again. We worship at

996
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:27,119
[clears throat] the shrine of our own

997
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,680
point of view.

998
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,720
>> Yes.

999
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,720
>> Wow.

1000
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,720
>> Yeah.

1001
00:39:31,782 --> 00:39:34,320
>> [laughter]

1002
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,320
>> He going to be impressed with something

1003
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,119
I saying. Oh, come on now. Give and

1004
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,760
bring. But really,

1005
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,240
I do think that that is actually that is

1006
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,079
idolatry at its highest form.

1007
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,440
>> Is to think that the way that you see it

1008
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,320
is the way that it is. What I try to do

1009
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,920
with my life is [clears throat]

1010
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,680
is to understand your perspective.

1011
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,720
And while other people talk about what

1012
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,680
you do, I always wonder why.

1013
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,839
I always want to empathize even with my

1014
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:10,640
enemy to make sure that my enemy is not

1015
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,079
a friend in disguise

1016
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,760
or or somebody who has been hurt in such

1017
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,800
a way that they react in a way that that

1018
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,240
yes wounded me but not intentionally. I

1019
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,480
try not to smack a patient.

1020
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,920
Pastor Ar. Bernard talks about that when

1021
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,520
when people come to him or come at him

1022
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
or at anyone with anger.

1023
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,240
>> Yeah.

1024
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,520
>> First thing you ask is who hurt you?

1025
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,440
>> Yeah.

1026
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,400
>> So because that's usually where it

1027
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,160
>> brilliant by the way.

1028
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,040
>> Yeah. That's my that's my man.

1029
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,960
>> Yeah. He's brilliant. Who who hurt you?

1030
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,079
That is not generally the first thing we

1031
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,640
ask when we are offended. But it might

1032
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,160
be a good takeaway to take with you from

1033
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,079
this meeting.

1034
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,240
>> Instead of deciding, I don't deal with

1035
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,240
her. I don't like him. I can't stand

1036
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,200
them. They're ignorant. They're stupid.

1037
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,680
They're hateful. They're demonic.

1038
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,920
Maybe the first question to ask is who

1039
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,920
hurt you?

1040
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,440
>> Because

1041
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,920
I think it's easier to love

1042
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,200
things you understand.

1043
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,520
And if you can begin to understand the

1044
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,440
other person's perspective,

1045
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,400
it changes how you pray for them. It

1046
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,400
changes how you handle them. And it most

1047
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,680
importantly leaves the door open. The

1048
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,040
most amazing thing I'm going to preach

1049
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,880
to you minute. The most amazing thing

1050
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,040
about the prodical son story to me. It's

1051
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,200
not the prodical son. I know what it is

1052
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,040
to drift away. I also know what it is to

1053
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,359
be the elder brother and stay and feel

1054
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,680
ignored. I stayed in one ministry for

1055
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,520
seven years and only preached twice. And

1056
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,359
my big job was to clean the baptism

1057
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,200
pools. So I understand the elder

1058
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,200
brother. I understand the prodical son

1059
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,200
cuz I have gone on a few adventures in

1060
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,119
my life. I'll keep them to myself, but I

1061
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,359
have. Uh but the star of the text is the

1062
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,359
father because

1063
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:04,640
he left [clears throat] the door open

1064
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:07,119
for the son to come home.

1065
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,240
And I find very few people in life leave

1066
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:15,800
the door open for change.

1067
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,800
Chapter six, passing the baton.

1068
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,359
>> You You have in a lot of ways left the

1069
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,200
door open for other people to come

1070
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,440
behind you, for other people to

1071
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,640
experience change, for other people to

1072
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,040
have careers. You talked about uh the

1073
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,560
level of training that you have. Uh I

1074
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,000
talked about the level of training, the

1075
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,400
scholarships that you've given to other

1076
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,079
people that created massive careers. His

1077
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,640
name escapes me right now. the guy who

1078
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,920
played in Black Panther that everybody

1079
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,200
catching. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1080
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,480
>> It's interesting you mentioned that cuz

1081
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,280
I was about to tell a story about

1082
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,359
>> Tell everybody.

1083
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:53,599
>> No, I was I was I was on Broadway and uh

1084
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:56,880
uh uh they had a screening of Black

1085
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,119
Panther. So, I told Ryan Cougler, the

1086
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,560
director, that I was going to come. So,

1087
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,520
I snuck in cuz I didn't want to deal

1088
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,880
with the the red carpet. I'm low-key

1089
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,880
person. I don't take pictures and all

1090
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,960
that. So, I went in the back way and

1091
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,880
Ryan Cougler and Chad were were were

1092
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,920
there talking

1093
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,119
and uh he's like, "Oh, you're just the

1094
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,319
person I wanted to see." I said, "Yeah,

1095
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,079
I want to see you, too." Cuz he owed me

1096
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,760
some money. But but when I sat in the

1097
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,720
audience,

1098
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,359
when I sat in the audience and and

1099
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,200
watched that film,

1100
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,880
I understood that the baton had been

1101
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,640
passed.

1102
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,720
You know, I looked at the I said, "Boy,

1103
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,280
these young boys are gone."

1104
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,880
>> Yeah.

1105
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,480
>> To the tune of a billion dollars that

1106
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,960
movie ended up making. I said, "They're

1107
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:47,119
gone." Now, you know, when you run a

1108
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,760
relay race and you hand the baton off,

1109
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,599
you don't stop. As soon as you hand it

1110
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,599
off, you run behind the person. So, I

1111
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,040
handed it off and I'm running behind

1112
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,480
him, but I know I'm not going to make it

1113
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,960
all the way around the track.

1114
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,599
>> Yeah.

1115
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,800
>> Now, none of us knew that.

1116
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,880
>> That's good. that Chad was.

1117
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,880
>> That's good right there. [laughter]

1118
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,440
That's good right there. That's good

1119
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,240
right there.

1120
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,240
>> That's good right there.

1121
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,920
>> Oh, that's good right there, [laughter]

1122
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,480
>> man. I'm ready to go over here and throw

1123
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,720
$20 on the altar because

1124
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,800
>> But I had to I had to when I watched the

1125
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,960
movie, I had to shed a tear. I mean, I

1126
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,880
sat there and I shed a tear. I'm like,

1127
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,359
man, these young boys are gone.

1128
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,599
>> Yeah.

1129
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,599
>> You know,

1130
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,800
not make anything out of myself, but

1131
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,720
Sydney took it a certain distance. I

1132
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,680
took it a certain distance and now

1133
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,880
they gone.

1134
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,920
>> Yeah. Yeah.

1135
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,280
>> They gone.

1136
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,880
>> And I I think it

1137
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,319
>> And my son's one of them.

1138
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,800
>> Yeah.

1139
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,040
>> Yeah.

1140
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,720
>> Yeah. My son is [cheering]

1141
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,079
>> That's the greatest feeling in the

1142
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,240
world. When you

1143
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,640
>> And my daughter, remember I said so.

1144
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,560
>> Yeah.

1145
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,680
>> Olivia Washington. Just remember I said

1146
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,480
so.

1147
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,480
>> Yeah.

1148
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:02,000
>> Hey, sister. to to be at this stage now

1149
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,839
and not be jealous.

1150
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,040
To be at this stage and not be envious.

1151
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,440
To be at this stage and be glad to see

1152
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,839
younger men and women women coming up

1153
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,839
and grabbing that baton while you are

1154
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,560
yet running.

1155
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,400
You you are not angry or jealous or

1156
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,960
competing with them. You're kind of

1157
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:26,000
running to make sure they're okay. Go

1158
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:28,319
on. Go on. Go on. I I enjoy

1159
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,400
coaching who's next more than being

1160
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,640
who's next.

1161
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,200
>> Yeah,

1162
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,920
>> me too.

1163
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,560
>> You You too.

1164
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,520
>> Me too.

1165
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,720
>> That stage I find is not always

1166
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,200
prevalent in our generation because some

1167
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:45,440
in our generation are still wrestling

1168
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:49,839
with who am I outside of what I do?

1169
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,800
>> And if I am not this then I don't see a

1170
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:58,000
role. But I see a clear path. I'm happy

1171
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,960
to be Timothy's Paul. I'm happy to be uh

1172
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Ruth's Naomi. I'm I'm hope I'm happy to

1173
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,960
be Elisha's Elijah

1174
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,599
>> because I know what it is to be young

1175
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,839
and run and have no one to talk to

1176
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,160
>> and have no safe place to lay your head

1177
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:20,400
and have nobody to pull me over into the

1178
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:23,040
corner and say, "Don't slap nobody on

1179
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,400
stage." Did you see them? You need

1180
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:31,200
somebody. And you're not really a father

1181
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:33,119
until you care enough to chew me out.

1182
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,280
>> And you're not really a son until you

1183
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,960
can be chewed out and still come back to

1184
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,760
my arms and understand father love

1185
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,680
doesn't sound like mama love.

1186
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,920
>> And we have a generation of people who

1187
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,800
have been raised to the tune of a mama

1188
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,560
love.

1189
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,079
>> And they don't they anytime you say

1190
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,640
something harsh, they see you as an

1191
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,720
enemy. and react and fight you rather

1192
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,000
than to understand. It takes energy to

1193
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,480
care. It takes energy to argue. It takes

1194
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,839
energy to confront you. You could have

1195
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,079
sat in your seat at the Oscars and let

1196
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,560
that go down. But you got out of your

1197
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,160
seat.

1198
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,480
>> No, I couldn't have sat in my seat.

1199
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,000
>> Huh?

1200
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,440
>> No way. I could have sat in my seat.

1201
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,640
>> No way you could sit in your seat. Tell

1202
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,079
me why.

1203
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,119
>> That's just not who I am.

1204
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,760
>> It's not who you are.

1205
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,680
>> No, it's not.

1206
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,079
>> And that's exactly my point.

1207
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,640
>> Okay. that that you just proved my

1208
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,079
point. That's not who I am. You

1209
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,640
understand who you are and you're

1210
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:29,680
comfortable enough in your own skin that

1211
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:33,480
you're concerned when another rate when

1212
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,480
another runner trips.

1213
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,200
>> That's exactly my point.

1214
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:41,760
[applause]

1215
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,480
First of all,

1216
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,678
it's good to see you. Good to be seen by

1217
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,678
you. [laughter]

1218
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,800
>> Friend of mine used to say that. I used

1219
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,240
to love that. Anytime somebody would

1220
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,200
say, "Good to see you." So good to be

1221
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,560
seen by you.

1222
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,560
>> Yeah, it is good. It's good to see you

1223
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,400
after the Oscars, after all the stuff

1224
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,960
you went through, after everything you

1225
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,040
handled, to jump on a plane, to fly out

1226
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,280
here on the red eye with no sleep and

1227
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,960
come up on the stage to talk to a group

1228
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,319
of people that you don't need and you

1229
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,400
didn't have to is absolutely stellar. I

1230
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,040
want to thank you for [cheering]

1231
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,480
>> this is the this is the this is the I

1232
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,359
don't know if I said it up when I was up

1233
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,240
here man man gives the award God gives

1234
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,640
the reward.

1235
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,400
>> Yeah.

1236
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,040
>> This is the reward for me.

1237
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,800
>> Really?

1238
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,240
>> You know

1239
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:33,200
awards are good [applause] but this is

1240
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,880
better. This is this is this is food for

1241
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,680
me.

1242
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,368
>> Good. It's food for us. Is it not food

1243
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,388
for us?

1244
00:48:39,368 --> 00:48:41,388
[applause]

1245
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:48,720
Chapter 7, Denzel's Prayer.

1246
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,559
I hope it doesn't put you on the spot

1247
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,880
really, but I'm going to put you on the

1248
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,119
spot. And I'll only ask you to do this

1249
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,240
because you do it every morning for your

1250
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,720
cast and your crew.

1251
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,359
I am going to ask you to close this.

1252
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,960
>> Let's bow our heads.

1253
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:11,040
Let's bow our heads.

1254
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:14,240
Dear father in heaven, we thank you.

1255
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,359
We know that to whom much is given, much

1256
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,680
is expected, much is required.

1257
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:22,319
[snorts] And we know that you require

1258
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:26,079
from each and every one of us our

1259
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:29,680
undivided love for you.

1260
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:31,359
You are our beacon of light in this

1261
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,839
darkness.

1262
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,800
And we say thank you and thank you and

1263
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:39,040
thank you and thank you and thank you

1264
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,079
not just for what you've done but what

1265
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,800

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:19,119
pray that something we set up here

touches them and and and and makes their

1282
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,960
relationship with you stronger,

1283
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,079
