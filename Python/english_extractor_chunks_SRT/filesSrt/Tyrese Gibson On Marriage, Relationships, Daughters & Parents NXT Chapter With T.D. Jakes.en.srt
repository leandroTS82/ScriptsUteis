1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,799
If I had my mother and my father at the

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,000
same house, I probably wouldn't be here.

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,080
>> Yeah.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,120
>> So, I said, [music] "I forgive you

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,000
because just maybe God removed you out

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,120
of the house,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,960
>> right?"

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,520
>> Because I would have been a crackhead.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,279
>> Yeah. By now, you should know I'm TD

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,320

part of the day so far is hearing you,

Bishop Jake, read off my Wikipedia page.

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,550
[laughter]

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,840
>> I am not worthy.

>> Oh, you are.

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,119
>> Got so much more to do.

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,439
>> Oh, God.

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,079
>> I I want to fill in some of the blanks

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,920
in between the mountain tops. We covered

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,520
the mountain tops in the introduction,

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
but I want to talk about some of the

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,840
other things that you have learned along

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:50,320
the way about life, about family, about

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,640
self, and the complexities of all of it.

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,759
Chapter one,

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,040
recreating yourself. I want to welcome

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,520
you first of all.

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,000
>> Thank you.

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,640
>> To be a part of this great uh next

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,960
chapter podcast. You've had many Next

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,280
Chapters. You've had to turn the page

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,679
many times and recreate yourself and

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,440
expose different parts of yourself in

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,680
order to have the longevity and the

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,520
career that you've had from author to

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,440
R&B singer to actor uh to action actor

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,720
to all the many many things that we've

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,680
seen you do. And it's not easy to be

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,160
able to be a chameleon that can fit into

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,360
various situations like that. What do

61
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,360
you attribute that to?

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Um,

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,480
if you've never met a person with blind

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
faith, I'm right here.

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,959
>> All right.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,440
>> No point of reference. See, I'm not the

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,840
son of Barry Gordy.

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
>> Yeah.

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,400
>> Anita Baker is not my mother.

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
>> Right.

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,239
>> Gladis Knight. I was not raised in a

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,440
house with executives and musicians and

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,760
people. I wasn't raised by Will Smith.

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,000
>> Yeah.

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
>> I wasn't raised by Sdney Portier.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,332
>> Yeah.

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,519
>> Denzel is not my father. I wish he was.

78
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:10,080
[laughter]

79
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,560
>> Right. Because you're being raised in a

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,519
house.

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,959
>> Yes.

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,680
>> Where it's not just the talent, it's the

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,080
dialogue. It's the business. It's the

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,680
understanding. It's all of the things

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
that you would hope to say, "Well, if

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,159
you're going to take this journey, you

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
don't have to worry about being

88
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,599
blindsided about what's around the

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,280
corner before you get there because

90
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,519
mommy and daddy already had a

91
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,879
conversation with you about the traps,

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,360
the things to avoid,

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,599
>> right?

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
>> You know, giving you the heads up, like,

95
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,480
you know,

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,239
>> uh, and so

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,239
>> blind faith.

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:50,000
>> Um, I cannot believe that's my resume. I

99
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,280
cannot believe that I'm the first in my

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
family to ever see or achieve or

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,680
accomplish the things that God has had

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,760
in mind for me. And the pressure that

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
comes with being the only

104
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,439
>> The pressure

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
>> is scary.

106
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,640
>> The pressure is scary. The pressure is

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,400
real. Let me before I ask you, I want to

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,599
follow down that trail. So, hold that

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,320
thought. Uh we recently hooked up uh in

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,919
Charleston, South Carolina at a wedding.

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,320
We've been knowing each other for years

112
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,840
and years and we got together at the

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,759
wedding at a [clears throat] pretty

114
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,800
tough time in your life. You just lost

115
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,720
your father. Yeah.

116
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
>> And we were able to minister to you and

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,960
encourage you. And I wondered in my

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,040
mind,

119
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,840
the guy who was sitting on the back of

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,639
the bus drinking a Coke or Pepsi or

121
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,320
whatever it was and got discovered and

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,600
entered into a career that was

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,400
absolutely amazing. Never fully goes

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,960
away. Money doesn't take that away.

125
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,520
Grammys doesn't take that away. You have

126
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,479
to live with who you were and who you

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,520
are at the same time and learn how to

128
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,240
make a homogeneous connection between

129
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,960
the past and the present and the future.

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,960
How do you do that?

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,218
>> I don't know. [laughter]

132
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
>> I don't know. I've never

133
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,479
>> Is it hard?

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,120
>> I've never heard it broken down in such

135
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,199
a scientific way. like you just went

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
boom boom boom boom and

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,080
>> you can't get rid of my point is you

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,759
can't get rid of you can't totally

139
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,759
dismiss

140
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,160
your upbringing and your training and

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,039
there's a part of you that you learn how

142
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,199
to survive in the world in the streets

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,160
in the city and there's a part of you

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,240
that had to learn how to survive uh in

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
California and Los Angeles in the

146
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,320
Hollywood scene and there's a part of

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,400
you that had to learn how to do business

148
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,720
and all of them come home with you at

149
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,360
night.

150
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
>> Yes.

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,080
>> All of them.

152
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,039
>> You didn't leave leave the guy on the

153
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,520
bus. He's still there. And so

154
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,440
>> a lot of people don't realize that. You

155
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,440
get it? A lot of people don't realize

156
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,479
it. So when you find yourself in a

157
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,880
situation,

158
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,360
>> it's which guy does the talking? Who's

159
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,880
in who's going to drive the car? Is Is

160
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,039
it going to be the guy from Philly? Is

161
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,520
it going to be the guy from from

162
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,160
Hollywood? Is it going to be the writer?

163
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:20,880
Uh how do you manage that? Well,

164
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,600
I think of myself as a a black octopus.

165
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,919
My arms is in 30 different places and

166
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
they're all working at the same time.

167
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,639
>> At the same time.

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,479
>> And so I'm the head and I'm the heart

169
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,919
and then my arms is just everywhere. And

170
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,120
we're doing things and trying to achieve

171
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,479
things that are all happening in real

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,280
time. And each project and its each

173
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,039
situation is in various different levels

174
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,520
and you don't want to lose sight of any

175
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,160
of them,

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,759
>> right?

177
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:58,639
>> Um and then what a blessing it's been

178
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,639
that the singer has helped audition and

179
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,440
set up the success of the actor.

180
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,080
>> Right.

181
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,400
>> And then the actor and the singer has

182
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,039
given birth to the entrepreneur.

183
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,440
>> Yes.

184
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,080
>> And then the coat kid is in the back of

185
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,560
the bus.

186
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,759
>> Yeah. and he's riding the wave.

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,240
>> I started this.

188
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
>> Yeah.

189
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,639
>> And I'm on the bus and we got a lot of

190
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,039
seats and whatever version of Tyrese

191
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,599
y'all end up seeing, we're all headed

192
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,160
that way. And the bus is being driven by

193
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,199
God.

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,919
>> My problem is all of my all of my TD

195
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,240
Jake's want to talk at the same time.

196
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,560
And so it just depends on who ask me and

197
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,440
what tone of voice you ask me in which

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
one you're going to get

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,639
>> and what environment.

200
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,520
>> Yeah. And what environment I'm in. And I

201
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,360
have to manage those those people. Uh

202
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,280
the apostle Paul said when I would do

203
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
good evil is present with me that which

204
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,639
I would not do. [clears throat] I do oh

205
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,280
wretched man that I am. Who shall

206
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,039
deliver me from the body of this death,

207
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,720
this sin, this this human experience and

208
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,639
all of those people live with you. So

209
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,520
you're in a mansion now

210
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,360
>> and you're and you're eating something

211
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,160
that you ate when you were back home.

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
Neckbones.

213
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,280
>> That's right.

214
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,520
>> Neckbones in a mansion. Okay. uh

215
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,199
chitlins on China. Yeah. The the the the

216
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,039
the

217
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,440
unique experience we have as a people of

218
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,000
having climbed up and been colored,

219
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,400
we've been negroes, we've been black,

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,319
we've been we've been [ __ ] we've

221
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,800
been everything to the point that

222
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,879
there's sometimes an identity crisis,

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,520
not just through us corporately, but

224
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,760
individually in finding yourself. And I

225
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,479
wonder, did anybody else ever feel that

226
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,800
way?

227
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,760
Um, yes.

228
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,360
>> Yeah.

229
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,399
>> You know, you're you're

230
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,120
I've had so many moments

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,959
in my life

232
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,080
where

233
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:58,880
I know that I had to dig deep within me

234
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,720
because the things that I have in mind

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,959
for me,

236
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,240
you realize that other people don't have

237
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,279
them in mind for you,

238
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,160
>> right?

239
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,920
And so when someone makes it clear, no,

240
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,800
no, no, we don't have that in mind for

241
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,760
you.

242
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,120
>> And I have it in mind for myself,

243
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,000
it won't go away because this person or

244
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,640
this room or this situation denied you

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,279
of what you feel like belongs to you.

246
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,399
>> Yeah.

247
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,200
>> And so the appetite, the determination,

248
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,920
it's um the self-t talk.

249
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,519
>> Yeah. Yes.

250
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,680
>> The self motivation.

251
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,440
>> Yeah. the speaking over yourself, the

252
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,680
pouring over yourself,

253
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,600
>> the the

254
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,800
>> you know, and and the thing is

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,160
>> I I want to say this, uh I've I've I've

256
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,680
been really struggling with how to put

257
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,000
words to this because there's a chosen

258
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,800
few that will that will hear a piece of

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,600
this and decide it goes over their head.

260
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,519
You know, selfish

261
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,880
starts with the word self.

262
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,880
>> Uhhuh.

263
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,959
>> And they've made selfish and being

264
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,440
selfish a negative. But most of us are

265
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,920
giving, doing, showing up for people

266
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,560
mentally, emotionally, physically,

267
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,279
financially, psychologically, and we're

268
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,079
overextending ourselves and giving of

269
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,680
ourselves. And we're depleted. Yes.

270
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,600
>> And we're tired

271
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,519
>> and we're sick and we're wiped out and

272
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
we got nothing left for ourselves.

273
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,320
>> Unappreciated.

274
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,079
>> And they don't care to notice.

275
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,640
>> Yeah. They don't care.

276
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,519
>> They don't. I'm here to get what I'm

277
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,000
here to get.

278
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,880
>> Right.

279
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,440
>> And even if you if I wipe you completely

280
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,760
out.

281
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,837
>> Yeah. And so I have allowed myself to be

282
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,240
more selfish

283
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:48,480
[clears throat]

284
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,320
>> and focus on me

285
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,399
>> and say,

286
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,959
"I'm not returning that text or that

287
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,120
call because I don't have the time or

288
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,800
the bandwidth to be on the receiving end

289
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,160
of what you're about to dump on me."

290
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,200
>> Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,800
>> So, and then especially when you know

292
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,279
what the phone call is going to be

293
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,800
about,

294
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,040
>> right? So now you got to say,

295
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,240
I'm not going to give you emotional

296
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,800
access to me,

297
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,640
>> right?

298
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,440
>> Because you're going to change the

299
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,120
energy of my day. So I'm going to make

300
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,760
the selfish decision to say if I want my

301
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,880
day to be better, it's not going to

302
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,240
include you.

303
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,680
>> Right?

304
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,640
you will not want to miss as he shares

305
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,720
his personal experience with grief and

306
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,680
losing parents.

307
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,000
You know, when you talked about somebody

308
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
like Denzel was not your father, you

309
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,800
didn't grow up in an environment where

310
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,320
you had a model to fit where you ended

311
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,399
up, you know, blueprint. A model.

312
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,959
>> Yeah. No blueprint, anything like that.

313
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,600
I think every man and probably every

314
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,560
woman yearns to have in their parents

315
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,040
some sort of shape uh measurement

316
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,839
pattern blueprint of what they're going

317
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,560
through and what they're going to be.

318
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,040
>> We look from that from our father.

319
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,360
>> Yes.

320
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,079
>> My father got sick when I was 10.

321
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,320
>> He died when I was 16. [clears throat]

322
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:18,240
>> I realized when I was 30 that as I wept

323
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,920
for him, I was weeping for me.

324
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,959
I recognized that I wasn't just weeping

325
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,519
at the loss of him. I was weeping at the

326
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,839
at the questions I didn't have answered

327
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,399
at the at the things that I didn't have

328
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,639
resolved. You know, did you really love

329
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,680
me? What did you really think of me? Did

330
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,639
you never got to see me win? When when

331
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,079
you lost your father,

332
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,600
it's part of the pain coming from inside

333
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:51,399
your own house.

334
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,399
This is what's interesting.

335
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:01,480
When my father passed away, rest in

336
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,480
peace to that brother, to that man,

337
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:09,040
I went to St. Louis to see him. stage 4

338
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,680
pancreatic cancer. Life was riddled with

339
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,880
alcoholism and crack cocaine and just

340
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:19,839
never quite got his hands around

341
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:23,120
figuring it out. And and and

342
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,079
I said to him, I just want you to know I

343
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,240
forgive you.

344
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:34,240
And and I wanted him to know why. I

345
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,440
said, "I forgive you for not being there

346
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,200
to protect me, for not giving me the

347
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,959
heads up of what's around the corner." I

348
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,800
don't know that he would have been

349
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,519
anybody that would have changed my life

350
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,040
in business or changed my, you know, I

351
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,959
don't know that my father was ever a

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,279
Barry Gordy that can sit me down and

353
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,160
say, "Son, don't sign that deal and

354
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,720
here's why."

355
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,120
>> Yeah.

356
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,440
>> But I said to him, "I forgive you." And

357
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,199
then I realized that if my mother, rest

358
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,320
in peace,

359
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,800
messed my life up with the 27 years of

360
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,839
alcohol, the verbal, emotional,

361
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,160
psychological, and physical abuse, and

362
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,040
all of the abuse that was in my house,

363
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,560
and it's still affecting me to this day.

364
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,680
If I had my mother and my father at the

365
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,880
same house, I probably wouldn't be here.

366
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,000
>> Yeah.

367
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,959
So I said, "I forgive you because just

368
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
maybe God removed you out of the house,

369
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,839
>> right?

370
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
>> Because I would have been a crackhead."

371
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,959
>> Yeah.

372
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,199
>> I would have been verbally and

373
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,920
physically abusive to my mother the way

374
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,560
you were.

375
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,240
>> Yeah.

376
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,839
>> There was other men that came in my

377
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,639
house that ended up doing it to my

378
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,519
mother ultimately. And so I was

379
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,600
introduced to love and I was raised to

380
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,320
believe that this is what love is. Love

381
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,320
is not kind. Love is not gentle. Yeah,

382
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,959
>> love is verbally abusive. Love is

383
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,120
physically abusive. Love is all of these

384
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,199
things that I was raised in.

385
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,440
>> And so I would always find myself

386
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,880
gravitating towards women that I would

387
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,000
be fighting and arguing, being

388
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,040
dysfunctional with,

389
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,680
>> right?

390
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,000
>> And anybody else that any other version

391
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,360
of love that I was in the present of

392
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,760
felt soft. It felt uh it felt uh boring.

393
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,120
>> Yeah.

394
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,519
>> You you ain't argue.

395
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,360
>> Yeah. Well, she must don't love you if

396
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,160
you ain't willing to fight and argue.

397
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,079
And so that's and so I have to I had to

398
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,600
say to him, "Thank you for removing

399
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,639
yourself from my life because if the

400
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,880
crack cocaine and the alcoholism and

401
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,639
everything that you were doing, that

402
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,199
would have all been an impression that

403
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,279
you would have made on my life that as a

404
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,120
grown man, I would have still been

405
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,000
deeply hurt by and affected by because I

406
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,880
would have been raised by another level

407
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,759
of trauma.

408
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,320
>> Right?

409
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:04,079
>> So, so as an example, you know, people

410
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,360
love to look at you, Bishop Jake, and

411
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,759
say, "Look at him."

412
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
>> Yeah.

413
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,759
>> In the mega church.

414
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,240
>> Yeah.

415
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,079
>> Look at him what he's driving, what he's

416
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,000
living in. Look at him with his wife,

417
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:18,399
and look at him with his daughter who's

418
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,360
now out there on stage changing lives.

419
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,639
Um and Sarah Jakes who I'm so proud of

420
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,199
and I know you are.

421
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,320
>> Yeah.

422
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,000
>> And

423
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,920
>> but they they they always look at the

424
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,360
fruits and the outcome.

425
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,639
>> Yeah. Yeah.

426
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,360
>> And even if you make them aware of the

427
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,759
strife and the struggles and the stuff

428
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,920
>> Yeah.

429
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,920
>> that the family had to navigate through.

430
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,040
When you mentioned, you know, I remember

431
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,839
I was preaching and I only had 17 people

432
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,399
in front of me.

433
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,880
>> Yeah. They have no concept no

434
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,079
>> of really wrapping their heads around

435
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,800
that because the version of Jake's

436
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:01,199
Bishop Jake that they're looking at

437
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,800
>> is on the grounds of 40 books and mega

438
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,240
church and

439
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,280
>> where you are now.

440
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,959
>> Yeah.

441
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,439
>> And and they trap you in how they met

442
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,240
you.

443
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,799
>> That's they they they don't recognize

444
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,600
you wrote 42 books. They don't recognize

445
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,839
that you sold $500 million worth of

446
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,640
movies. They they they want to put you

447
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,360
in a place where they can assault you

448
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,000
with their implications of you. And and

449
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,439
and

450
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,200
>> you are how I met you.

451
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,280
>> Yeah. You are how I met you and you are

452
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,520
who I met you. And that's what I meant

453
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,679
earlier when I was talking about, you

454
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,679
know, you have to live with that guy who

455
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,880
grew up in that volatile home. He's

456
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,200
still in there. Yes, sir.

457
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,600
>> Okay. And money didn't take him away.

458
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,600
No. and movies didn't take him away and

459
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,080
books didn't take him away. He's still

460
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,880
there bottled up somewhere inside. And

461
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,200
then this unresolved issue which I can

462
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,320
relate to. My father wasn't an alcoholic

463
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,000
but I can relate to an unresolved issue

464
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,720
uh with your father

465
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
is complicated. At Let me ask you this.

466
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,000
At what point or did you have a moment

467
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,320
that you recognized that you were an

468
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,080
orphan?

469
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,039
>> Yeah.

470
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,919
That hit me a month ago.

471
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,919
>> And how did that feel?

472
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,559
>> The idea of being an orphan

473
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,000
was something that we seen on television

474
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,640
>> documentaries

475
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,559
>> specifically throughout Africa,

476
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,880
>> right? you know, like, oh, there's this

477
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,520
village of kids that are orphans cuz

478
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,720
their mother and father died of HIV AIDS

479
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,120
or, you know, a bunch of bad guys came

480
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,320
in and killed a bunch of people and now

481
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
here's these foundations raising kids as

482
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,799
orphans,

483
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:59,039
>> right? And so when they delivered my

484
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:01,679
father's ashes to my house

485
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:05,120
and I was able to put my father's ashes

486
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,360
next to my mother's ashes,

487
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,559
I said, "My mother and father haven't

488
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,919
lived under the same roof

489
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,600
since they divorced."

490
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,120
>> Wow.

491
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,200
>> And now they're here.

492
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,200
My mother and my father never even made

493
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,039
it to my house that I've been living in

494
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,520
in Atlanta for 9 years.

495
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,679
>> Wow.

496
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,600
>> So, this is their first time living

497
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,360
under the same roof with their son.

498
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,320
And then

499
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,000
I thought,

500
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,200
well, at least they're here.

501
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,600
>> Yeah.

502
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,640
And

503
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,720
and then I'm I'm a bit of a a junkie for

504
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,840
the sense of humor of God.

505
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,360
>> Uhhuh.

506
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,280
>> So I'm thinking to myself,

507
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,840
my mother and father are finally under

508
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,320
the same roof with a baby boy.

509
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
>> Yeah.

510
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,919
>> Right. And my mother died on Valentine's

511
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
Day.

512
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,280
>> Wow.

513
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,039
>> After giving birth to an R&B singer. If

514
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,120
you if you're not booked to do any

515
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,480
concerts throughout the year as a

516
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,240
singer, you're likely going to get

517
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,120
booked on Valentine's Day,

518
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
>> right?

519
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,400
>> Um, and so there's a sense of humor in

520
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,080
that.

521
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,520
>> Uh,

522
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,440
and then I always have my mother and

523
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,720
father's ashes. I don't always announce

524
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,720
it to everybody,

525
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,080
>> but every meeting and conversation that

526
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,080
I have,

527
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,039
>> I always have my mother and father's

528
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,120
ashes in the room with me

529
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,440
>> because I want them to know how proud I

530
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,600
am of them for doing the best they

531
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,679
could.

532
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,799
Um, [clears throat]

533
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,799
and

534
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,000
>> when nobody's around, do you ever talk

535
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,400
to them?

536
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,559
>> Yes. Yes, I do. It's form of therapy.

537
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
>> Yeah. I always say, "Mama, I don't know

538
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,200
what's about to happen, but they pulling

539
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,520
up right now and and and and just cover

540
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,679
me. I know you was always a praying

541
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,480
mama, and I know you still with me, Mom.

542
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,240
So, just pray for me with I I I might

543
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,640
not have the words in this meeting,

544
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,440
right?

545
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,960
>> But I want it to be something." And then

546
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,960
the biggest thing

547
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,600
is

548
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
I don't have it all figured out, Dad.

549
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,760
>> Yeah,

550
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,200
>> I don't. And that scares me.

551
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,679
>> Yeah.

552
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,320
>> Chapter three. You may not even know

553
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,400
what to name it, but you may be feeling

554
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,039
it. It's called Survivor's [music]

555
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:40,120
Remorse.

556
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,120
what God is doing right now.

557
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,760
I've always had this big appetite for

558
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,120
success. Never driven by money, driven

559
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,080
by impact. Mhm.

560
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,480
>> And what God is doing right now with

561
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,440
visions and ideas and dreams and the

562
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,240
things that keep me up at night, I've

563
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,440
had this thing in my mind

564
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,360
and and and God when you pray, I always

565
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,159
say pray specific prayers so that God

566
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,840
can specifically bless you and cover you

567
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,919
for the things that that you're

568
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,919
vulnerable about. Vulnerable about.

569
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,159
>> Yeah.

570
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:27,600
And so I'm in a place right now where I

571
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:30,080
am sure that God is about to take me

572
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,039
into these levels and this level of

573
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,760
stratosphere in my career.

574
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,080
And I don't feel prepared

575
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,760
for what God is about to do even though

576
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,640
I know he's about to do it.

577
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,720
>> Right? So now I'm on this mission where

578
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,280
I'm saying I am very specific about I

579
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,799
got to surround myself with people to

580
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,520
cover me spiritually

581
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,240
>> right

582
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,880
>> with the wisdom and the knowledge and

583
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,360
the blueprint and and pour into me to

584
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,520
say okay let's not talk about the winds

585
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,520
and what happens talk about the moments

586
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,080
where you almost wanted to give up.

587
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,120
>> Yeah. Talk about the moments that where

588
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,760
you had to push through the trauma and

589
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,840
the stress and the the press or the

590
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,280
social media attacks or the the

591
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,520
accusations or the talk about how you

592
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,080
got through that. What prayer did you

593
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,559
pray?

594
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,760
>> Yeah.

595
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,400
>> To get through that.

596
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,480
>> Yeah.

597
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:30,000
>> Because I I I and I say this in in my

598
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,440
own way respectfully. I I feel like

599
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,120
where I love you, Bishop,

600
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,280
is you have always been transparent

601
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,320
>> about the moments that you wanted to

602
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,440
quit and give up and the struggles

603
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,080
because

604
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,880
>> it's almost like survival's remorse,

605
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,840
right? where it's like everybody looks

606
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,720
at me as being so successful

607
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,080
and all I want to do is make y'all aware

608
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,280
of how hard and how challenging it has

609
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,320
been and how challenging it gets. And

610
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,320
you feel this overwhelming sense of

611
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,720
wanting to really break it all down. And

612
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,400
breaking it all down ultimately gives

613
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,080
folks permission to say, "Okay, I could

614
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,400
achieve it."

615
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,919
People are focused on the net worth and

616
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,480
the plane and the shiny building and how

617
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,216
big the church is.

618
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,236
>> But I don't have a plan. Go ahead.

619
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,236
[laughter]

620
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,441
Go ahead. Go ahead. Maybe that's

621
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,441
prophetic. [laughter]

622
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,760
Maybe somebody will sit there.

623
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:45,600
[laughter]

624
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,200
Big red bow. Big red bow. I welcome it.

625
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,559
>> He welcomes it. Yeah.

626
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,159
>> Uh so it's it's you know I there's

627
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,000
there's people that that think of

628
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,320
survivors remorse when they they think

629
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,440
of that and it's usually like ah you

630
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,720
know my friend died and we were in the

631
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,880
same car and and I survived and so there

632
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,840
survivors. But the other version of

633
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,960
survivors remorse is I'm more successful

634
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,039
than everybody in my family.

635
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,039
>> Yeah. I knew you win. I knew you win.

636
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,799
You ain't all of that. I knew you when

637
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,799
you were

638
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,440
you know there there there's a scripture

639
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,320
in the Bible that says I will give you

640
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:26,000
treasures in the darkness.

641
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,440
>> And at first I thought we made it in

642
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,880
life in spite of adversity.

643
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,600
>> Now [clears throat] I think we made it

644
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,600
because of adversity.

645
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,679
>> If if there had not been tension

646
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,520
>> there would be no muscles. Okay. If if

647
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,600
there had not been obstacles, if there

648
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,320
had not been something to prove, if you

649
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,440
hadn't felt invisible, you wouldn't have

650
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,760
screamed out, "I'm over here. See me,

651
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,120
hear me, feel me." That those sorts of

652
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,520
things become of paramount importance.

653
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,000
And also, I wanted to say to you because

654
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,240
you said something uh I think it's on

655
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,080
Facebook or on social media somewhere

656
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,559
where you talked about my wife and I

657
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,363
talking about marriage and how how it

658
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,760
helped you throughout. See, I see. Yeah,

659
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,480
[laughter]

660
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
>> I see you.

661
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,440
>> That was like almost 35 years ago.

662
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
>> Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,320
>> Yeah. Yeah. It's just

664
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,760
>> I think God gives us surrogate fathers

665
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,840
and mothers

666
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,200
>> to replace what we didn't have.

667
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,760
>> Yes. Chapter number four. Finding the

668
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,960
right partner. Oh yeah. You want to get

669
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:38,080
this? What was that like 35 years ago to

670
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,760
get some counsel as if I were talking to

671
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,600
you even though I were talking to a

672
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,200
screen?

673
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,120
>> You were talking to me.

674
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,600
>> Yeah.

675
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,400
>> I seen it on YouTube, but you were

676
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,960
talking to me.

677
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,640
>> Yeah.

678
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,880
>> And and that is that is why we love you

679
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,760
and and

680
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,600
we are so moved by you and your

681
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,559
transparency.

682
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,679
the way you unpacked that conversation

683
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,320
and dialogue and and went into specifics

684
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,200
about the the the working functioning

685
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,919
dynamics.

686
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,039
>> Yes.

687
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,760
>> Of your marriage.

688
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,240
>> Yes.

689
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,828
>> And then whenever your wife spoke

690
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,760
>> Yes. I mean to to see you sit back.

691
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:23,520
[sighs] Okay.

692
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,720
>> Yeah. You know, it was just really like

693
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,200
wow,

694
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,520
>> you know, to to just feel like this

695
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:37,200
alpha strong

696
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:39,840
dominant kind of man of God sits back

697
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,640
and he holds his wife at such a high

698
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,400
level of regard. So when she speaks, you

699
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,799
like you disappear.

700
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,520
>> Yeah.

701
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,120
>> And and you want nobody to be focused on

702
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,679
you while the queen is speaking.

703
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,000
>> Exactly.

704
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:57,200
>> Oh, it was I I I

705
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,399
>> She She is leather and lace.

706
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,799
>> And [clears throat] don't let the lace

707
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,279
fool you.

708
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,440
>> Don't let the lace fool you. Recently,

709
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,559
when I went through that health malady,

710
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,440
I had a heart attack. My wife never left

711
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,240
me for three days or nights.

712
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,880
>> She never left my side. Every time I

713
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,080
woke up, she was staring at me.

714
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,364
>> She She has a tenacity. She had just

715
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,559
gotten over a knee surgery.

716
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:24,399
[clears throat]

717
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,949
>> Uh we were dealing with all of those

718
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,919
things at the same time.

719
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:30,880
[cough]

720
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,520
What was really amazing,

721
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,679
she paid her knee no mind. She hadn't

722
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,399
walked on a cane or a walker or anything

723
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,120
since when I collapsed on that stage.

724
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,320
She ran over to where I was. She is

725
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,559
leather and lace. So when I sit back,

726
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,520
one of the greatest one of the greatest

727
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,320
choices we get to make in life is who we

728
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,480
are going to partner with. My God. And

729
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,559
that choice needs to be taken real

730
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,320
seriously because you're going to be in

731
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,440
the foxhole with that person.

732
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,880
>> Yes. And you need to know that when hell

733
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,919
breaks loose,

734
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
>> they're [clears throat] going to be

735
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,399
there. They're going to be back to back

736
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,960
and shouldertosh shoulder with you. And

737
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,039
there and you're going to be comfortable

738
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,360
>> with that closeness, you know,

739
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,159
vulnerability. Yeah. Because all of us

740
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,720
bring baggage. All of us had a a bus

741
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,039
moment. All of us came out of out of

742
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,679
some sort of pit or hole or trouble.

743
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,600
Even even wealthy successful people, we

744
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
have a tendency to think that if people

745
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
went to Ivy League schools and if they

746
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,960
they went to private schools, they had

747
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
no trauma. That's not true.

748
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,840
>> No.

749
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,679
>> Trauma knocks on every door. Yes.

750
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,480
>> And when you get your trauma and my

751
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,320
trauma mixed together, they either find

752
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,840
a way to fit together and it becomes a

753
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,039
key and a lock

754
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,440
>> or they clash together and we spend the

755
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,520
next 10 years fighting each other like

756
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,240
we're in the Vietnam War.

757
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,279
How did you know?

758
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,520
>> That's a good question. That's a good

759
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,159
question.

760
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,559
>> Because because and and my question is

761
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,200
coming from this place.

762
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,120
I've been married and divorced twice. My

763
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,640
divorce sadly has played out for the

764
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,440
world to see. Child support, baby mama

765
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,000
drama on full display. I'm almost like

766
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,159
the poster child at this point. And and

767
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,679
I've I've been proud to be able to speak

768
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,919
up and speak out about, you know, family

769
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,520
law, court system, and if you were born

770
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,320
a man, you walk in the courtroom,

771
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,480
they've already had a preset menu as to

772
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,000
what the outcome of this situation is

773
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,880
going to be. It does not matter what you

774
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,559
say or do or how fancy your lawyer is.

775
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:42,559
But how many relationships were you in

776
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,399
that allowed for you to say, "Okay, well

777
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,399
that was not it." And then that one was

778
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,720
not it. And then when you got to the

779
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,480
presence of your wife, how did you know

780
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,279
she was the one?

781
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,120
>> Well, first of all, I was a Christian. I

782
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,360
had the Holy Spirit. I had the inkling.

783
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,080
That doesn't mean I floated around the

784
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,840
room and had halos over my head. I was a

785
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,440
man. Okay. [laughter] Okay. I used to

786
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,880
tell my wife, there's a man up under

787
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,640
this robe. Okay? But but but the reality

788
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,919
is there is a knowing

789
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,799
that is spiritual. And this is what you

790
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,520
know it's it's not she's fine though she

791
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:26,720
is. It it's not her voice though she's

792
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:31,399
got the voice of velvet. It is

793
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,399
that we will always be friends,

794
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,960
that that I will always be for you, that

795
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,120
you will always be for me. I might screw

796
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,120
up, you might mess up, we might go

797
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,760
through hell, we might be under a

798
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,320
diialysis machine, but if you're on a

799
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,519
diialysis machine, I will have your

800
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,960
back. that that that feeling of

801
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,360
connection

802
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,919
>> especially when you grew up without it.

803
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,720
>> Yes sir.

804
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,720
>> It becomes extremely important to know

805
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,519
that you're not connected to my job, my

806
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,760
career, my name, my money, my fortune,

807
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,679
my education, my intellect or whatever

808
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,640
it is [clears throat]

809
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,120
that you really are into me. And the

810
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,080
problem is when you've never had that, a

811
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,679
lot of times you will repel it because

812
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,399
you're not used to it.

813
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,039
>> Wow. you will repel it and give it up

814
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,880
for somebody who fights like you said

815
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,480
and give it up for somebody who gives

816
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,360
conflict because we tend to be creatures

817
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,760
of habit and recreate situations that we

818
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,279
grew up in because we're at home in

819
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,760
hell.

820
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,279
>> If you were born in hell, when you go to

821
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,600
hell, you're at home.

822
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,640
>> Okay? So the first thing that has to be

823
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,840
broken and you have to break this is the

824
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,320
hell [clears throat] you were birthed in

825
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,120
and when you when you break out of that

826
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,880
and you finally decide that I deserve to

827
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,679
be loved

828
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,760
and I deserve to be treated well and I

829
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,120
deserve to have good things in my life.

830
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,519
And you stop self- sabotaging anybody

831
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,159
who cares about you because you have

832
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,000
this inner conflict going on that they

833
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,240
had nothing to do with, but they

834
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
inherited when they got you. When you

835
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,159
get real with you and you find somebody

836
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
who will sit there and listen at you and

837
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,840
talk to you and talk you down and get

838
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,159
you together and no, I'm not talking to

839
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,840
the star. I'm not talking to the actor.

840
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,480
I'm I'm talking [clears throat] to uh

841
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,799
the guy on the back of the bus because

842
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,159
he's he's still in there. Whoever

843
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,559
marries you marries all nine versions of

844
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,360
you.

845
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,559
>> Praise God.

846
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,840
>> Yeah. Because you can't act all the

847
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,440
time.

848
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,399
>> Pretty soon you have to take off the

849
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:50,720
mask with no lines. You have to be who

850
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,360
you are, who you really are. and uh

851
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,360
finding somebody who can embrace all

852
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:00,399
sides of you and then learning the

853
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:03,039
language to be able to explain yourself

854
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,240
to the person who is confused by your

855
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,760
behavior. When you learn the language to

856
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,480
say,

857
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,800
I know this is crazy about me and I may

858
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,960
not always be this way and I may outgrow

859
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,399
it, but when you do such and such a

860
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,359
thing, it scares me.

861
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,079
>> It triggers me.

862
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,240
>> It triggers me. Yeah. That that that's

863
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,639
what therapy gives you is language.

864
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,119
>> Yes.

865
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,399
>> It doesn't always give you cures. But it

866
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,480
does give you language.

867
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,879
>> Let me let me verbalize what I'm

868
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,119
feeling.

869
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,399
>> Yeah. Because if until you verbalize it,

870
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,760
you can't get it out.

871
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,079
>> Yeah. So you you got me counseling with

872
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,440
>> No, no, no. This is this is I came here

873
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,320
just for this. You feel it?

874
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,040
>> Oh my god. I you know, one of the things

875
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,800
I want you to know

876
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,599
um

877
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,760
that I'm like literally inspired by and

878
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,440
and I can speak for me and everybody

879
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,200
when it comes to you and your first

880
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,240
lady,

881
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,000
the level of regard

882
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:05,280
that y'all have for each other,

883
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,920
the level of nurturing and like while

884
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,560
you're preaching, your wife is at full

885
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,079
attention.

886
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,160
>> Yeah. Yeah. as if she didn't just arrive

887
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,240
with this man that's up here preaching

888
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,240
and she ain't going home with this man

889
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,079
preach. She's on the front row on high

890
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,079
alert like never it doesn't feel like

891
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,079
neither one of you guys have allowed

892
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,480
yourself to get too familiar.

893
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:34,400
>> No. No. and and there's such a honor and

894
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,839
decency and respect and covering around

895
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:41,119
that. And and so what you just shared

896
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:43,119
about when you had that moment on stage

897
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,960
and she had just had her own knee

898
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,320
surgery and every time you opened your

899
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,920
eyes, she was awake.

900
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,240
>> I'm not even surprised.

901
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,440
>> She threw that cane and ran out to meet

902
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,800
me. She ran a and I give her the credit

903
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,320
because you know uh generally when you

904
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,869
get married one of you is gifted and the

905
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,680
other is crazy. I'm the crazy one. Okay.

906
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,920
[laughter]

907
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,960
I'm the crazy one. But there's got to be

908
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,119
somebody stable who's consistent. But

909
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,680
you know most creative people are a

910
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,680
little bit weird. Okay. And so that

911
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,160
creativity that makes you walk into an

912
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,320
empty room and see it with brick on the

913
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,480
wall and stone on that wall and this

914
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,839
painted over here. creativity, that

915
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,640
imagination works for and against you.

916
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,920
>> Praise God.

917
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,560
>> Yeah. It gives you an idealism that is

918
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,680
hard for people to reckon with because

919
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:38,560
my wife can't see it till it's there.

920
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,079
>> I can walk into a dump and see a palace.

921
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,760
>> I'm I'm going to put the pool over

922
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,440
there. I'm put this over here. I'm gonna

923
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,400
do, you know, I got it in my head what

924
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,560
I'm gonna do. Yeah. I I dressed myself.

925
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,200
Yeah. I can see I know how I want it to

926
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,520
go. So [clears throat] opposites attract

927
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,200
but the very thing that attracts you

928
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,880
later repels you

929
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
>> because [clears throat] their steadiness

930
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,760
starts to feel like boring

931
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,400
>> and and your excitement starts to feel

932
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,440
like wow. And if you make it over that

933
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,640
hurdle,

934
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,960
>> if you make it over the hump, I figured

935
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,920
out that we're losing each other in the

936
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,560
turns of life. If you make it over

937
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,760
menopause and midlife crisis and make it

938
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,240
over surgeries and make it over grief

939
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,240
and make it over accidents that that

940
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,400
grief you went through

941
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,359
>> that's s that's got side effects.

942
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,720
>> Oh yeah. Absolutely.

943
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,560
>> You know it's it's like

944
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,160
>> the only person that's Yeah. The only

945
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,839
person experiencing that is the person

946
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,240
that's intimately with you every single

947
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,119
day.

948
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,440
>> It every day and all the versions of you

949
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:43,119
and how it expresses itself in anger and

950
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,040
fear and tears and and and can you

951
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,800
afford to break down and still be

952
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,119
respected in the morning. Those are the

953
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,560
kinds of things we we we got to do. But

954
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,960
I got to get I got to get through this

955
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,240
because

956
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,960
>> Well, I I wanted to say one last thing

957
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,000
if you don't mind.

958
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,599
>> Say it if you want.

959
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,480
>> I just want to say thank you.

960
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,960
I want to say thank you.

961
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,240
I want you to know how often I actually

962
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,119
pray for you.

963
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,079
>> Thank you.

964
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,960
>> And I'm saying thank you

965
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:17,760
because

966
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:21,280
you have literally changed this place.

967
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:25,440
You have decided

968
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,680
and God has been so present over your

969
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,000
life.

970
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,320
You have been a vessel. The messages

971
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,680
that got your cell phone tower into

972
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,680
Jesus is so strong. I I'm I'm sure that

973
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,320
at this point when you get out on stage

974
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,800
and you and you speak, you probably have

975
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,800
a couple bullet notes on on the topic

976
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,320
and everything that happens in between

977
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,079
them bullet notes,

978
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,599
>> you're channeling in real time on stage

979
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,599
>> and everybody in the audience leaves a

980
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,599
very different person than they showed

981
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,400
up as because you have allowed God to

982
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,040
speak through you and and display the

983
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,440
fullness of you, the good, the

984
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,800
transparency, the challenges, the ups,

985
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,280
the downs,

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,480
>> even your daughter having a child at a

987
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,040
young age. I mean, it what what do we

988
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,200
do? And you

989
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,800
>> you have

990
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,240
you have reinvented yourself over and

991
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,359
over and over in front of us. And I want

992
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,800
you to know

993
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:37,599
that I pose this question all the time.

994
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,640
Okay. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready.

995
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,720
>> Chapter number five. Material

996
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,537
possessions. Are they all they're

997
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,720
cracked up to be? Let's see what Tyrese

998
00:39:45,537 --> 00:39:49,359
[music] has to say.

999
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,839
>> When I speak in front of folks, I I say

1000
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,160
by a show of hands,

1001
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,680
uh, can anybody in here that's behind

1002
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,480
the cameras in this interview, can

1003
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,119
anybody in here right now, if you if you

1004
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,400
know what was the net worth of Dr.

1005
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,160
Martin Luther King when he was

1006
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,839
assassinated. Can anybody tell me what

1007
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,119
was in his bank? Don't Google it. Don't

1008
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,839
chat. GPT. Anybody know? No hands. What

1009
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,160
was the square footage of Dr. Martin

1010
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,960
Luther King's house when he was

1011
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,599
assassinated the day he died? What was

1012
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,560
the rim size on his car? Anybody know

1013
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,960
the brand of car he was driving or how

1014
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,720
many cars he had?

1015
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,200
Okay. So in my mind,

1016
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,680
we are not here to inspire people from

1017
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,920
materialistic possessions,

1018
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,320
>> our net worth, what we drive in, the

1019
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,480
square footage of our house.

1020
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:45,280
We are here to empty ourselves of

1021
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,240
everything that we can to give people

1022
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,520
permission to be great, to pull them up,

1023
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,480
to pour into them, to to activate

1024
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,520
something inside of them that could give

1025
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,000
them purpose to to pour into a prison

1026
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,880
inmate

1027
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,119
and say, "I'mma get out of here one day,

1028
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,599
and I'm going to decide to be great when

1029
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,480
I get out of here because Bishop TD DD

1030
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:14,720
Jake showed up with the prison ministry

1031
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:18,480
and poured into me what God has done

1032
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:21,040
through you through it all.

1033
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,480
>> I just have to say thank you.

1034
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:28,800
>> Wow. I often have a saying

1035
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:34,720
the real message that I bring to you is

1036
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:37,040
that God can do so much with so little.

1037
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,560
I [clears throat] honestly

1038
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,839
that that's the that's the story that he

1039
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:47,200
can do so much

1040
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:51,839
with so little that everybody is

1041
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:55,359
eligible because if he could use me, he

1042
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,193
could use anybody. Okay? Honestly, trust

1043
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,319
me, this is truth before God.

1044
00:41:57,193 --> 00:42:01,599
[clears throat]

1045
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,280
If if if he could you you know how our

1046
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,920
grandmothers and great-grandmothers

1047
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,119
could could make cornbread without eggs

1048
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,440
and and and then take powdered milk and

1049
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,760
make pancakes, stuff like that. That's

1050
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,680
what he did. He took nothing.

1051
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,280
>> He took mud and made a man

1052
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,440
>> and he's still shaping and he's still

1053
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,480
forming and he's still blowing and he's

1054
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,520
still breathing. And and the the reason

1055
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,599
that that I am a Christian is not

1056
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,440
because I have perfected being

1057
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,720
Christlike. It is that my only hope of

1058
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,720
being formed into something usable was

1059
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,359
the nostrils of the God that breathed

1060
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,599
the breath of life into me. So please

1061
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,040
know that. Please know that I am not

1062
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:51,839
this exceptional person. I had the same

1063
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,520
pain, trauma, life, crisis, confusion

1064
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,520
that you do.

1065
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,520
>> Same exact thing.

1066
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,359
>> But you're able to verbalize it.

1067
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,640
>> I can I can verbalize it.

1068
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,640
>> And that gift of verbalizing it. Yes.

1069
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,040
>> And but understanding.

1070
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,200
>> Mhm.

1071
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,480
>> If we're talking about a teleprompter.

1072
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,400
>> Yeah.

1073
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,079
>> Go read those same words on that

1074
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,200
teleprompter. And I promise it won't

1075
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,680
have the same. and Bishop TD Jake would

1076
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,680
read

1077
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,400
>> because I am in touch with myself.

1078
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,720
>> Praise God.

1079
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,000
>> I am definitely in touch with all parts

1080
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,839
of myself and and most people most

1081
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,839
people lie to themselves and they

1082
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,000
present the version of themselves they

1083
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,680
wish they were.

1084
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,040
>> And they're not in touch with all of

1085
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:38,079
themselves. So you can't do a 360 if

1086
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,030
you're determined to be a 180.

1087
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,560
Chapter number six gets real personal

1088
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,520
[music]

1089
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,960
when he starts to talk about a public

1090
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:50,400
divorce. Can you imagine?

1091
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,640
Dion and Tyrese's daughter,

1092
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,440
your your daughter living with you. I

1093
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,480
understand Dion tweeted something in

1094
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,720
response to fathers raising daughters

1095
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,079
that impacted you. Have you ever talked

1096
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:08,240
to Dion about raising kids after a

1097
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:13,680
divorce and being a a single father?

1098
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:16,640
>> Um, yes. We we've had conversations. Um,

1099
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:20,480
you know, it there's a lot of single

1100
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,960
fathers, a lot of single mothers. Mhm.

1101
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,760
>> Um,

1102
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,040
and so it it what's what's always

1103
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,280
interesting for me is

1104
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,839
I know what

1105
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
I want to talk to my daughter about.

1106
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,480
>> Mhm.

1107
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,400
>> I struggle with when.

1108
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,359
>> Mhm.

1109
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,359
>> Right. So

1110
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,680
when when you know that certain things

1111
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,920
are being said about you, when you know

1112
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,560
that you're being put in a certain

1113
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,760
light, when you know what's being

1114
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,760
written in court documents that will end

1115
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,720
up being posted on TMZ,

1116
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,040
>> right?

1117
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,839
>> You have to live with that.

1118
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,440
and and now

1119
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,359
social media and people in their

1120
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,319
comments.

1121
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,599
My goal is, okay, this is what's being

1122
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,599
said, but I just got to figure out when

1123
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,560
I'm going to have the conversation with

1124
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,160
my daughter because I got to mentally,

1125
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,480
emotionally,

1126
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:28,240
physically, and psychologically protect

1127
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:33,359
you. Um, and so we've been having a lot

1128
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,960
of fun with with uh the stuff that looks

1129
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,440
a certain way.

1130
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,200
>> And then once I do my part as a father

1131
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,599
and I set her down, I have these

1132
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,680
conversations, then she looks at things

1133
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,480
through a totally different lens.

1134
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,400
>> There's nothing like loving a daughter

1135
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,960
that changes how you handle a woman.

1136
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,119
>> Wow. [laughter]

1137
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,359
There's nothing like it. There's nothing

1138
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,119
like it that that that your girlfriend

1139
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,760
is somebody's daughter, that your wife

1140
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,640
is somebody's daughter. You don't really

1141
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,200
get it until you have a daughter and and

1142
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,240
and allow that daughter to speak into

1143
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,920
your life. Now, I'm I [clears throat]

1144
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,000
don't want to put you on the spot. I'm

1145
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,160
very protective of people. If you know

1146
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,720
anything about me at all, I'm extremely

1147
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,000
protective of people. But I understand

1148
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,319
you had a conversation with Holly Berry

1149
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,440
uh about divorce and about child

1150
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,839
support. As much as you are comfortable

1151
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,280
>> Yeah.

1152
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,680
>> with talking about that.

1153
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,280
>> Yeah.

1154
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,800
>> Can you share something with me?

1155
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:36,400
>> Yeah. Well, I I what I what I said to

1156
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,720
her uh it was on my Instagram. I posted

1157
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,599
it.

1158
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,560
>> Okay.

1159
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:44,560
>> And so it is public knowledge what I

1160
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:48,960
posted. Um, but it was actually on the

1161
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:52,160
topic most recently. It was about her

1162
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:56,079
saying that her current

1163
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,560
uh better half has been asking her to

1164
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,440
marry her cuz they've been together for

1165
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,240
a while now and she has been struggling

1166
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,079
with the idea of ever,

1167
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,839
you know, allowing herself to marry

1168
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,359
again. Um, so and I said, well, I could

1169
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,520
relate to that. You know, I've been in a

1170
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,880
relationship now with my lady Zeli for

1171
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,960
five years.

1172
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,119
>> And she's always hinting at marriage.

1173
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,960
And some people will say, "Oh, you're a

1174
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,680
band-aid. You're just filling in the

1175
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,359
blanks." And you know, uh, you know, at

1176
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,839
a certain point, he's going to dispose

1177
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,680
of you and then go find the woman that

1178
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:32,800
he actually wants to marry. But people

1179
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,560
don't understand is that your opinion is

1180
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,599
formulating from things that you have

1181
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,400
never experienced.

1182
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,280
>> Right? You don't know what it's like to

1183
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,200
wake up, get married, have a prenuptual

1184
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,000
agreement in place, have the prenup to

1185
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,119
get cracked where you end up paying all

1186
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,880
of her legal fees and my legal fees. And

1187
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,079
now I'm paying all this money to

1188
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,920
attorneys trying to protect what I have.

1189
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,520
And then you realize that somebody

1190
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,119
marries you and then they said, "I don't

1191
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,760
want to be here anymore." And then they

1192
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,160
trying to take everything that belongs

1193
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:09,119
to you with them.

1194
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:12,400
And it is really a painful process.

1195
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,960
And so, well, hey, if we could be happy

1196
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,520
and we could be together and we could

1197
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,440
not get married because if you ever

1198
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,160
decide that you don't want to be married

1199
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,200
anymore, now you're going to be another

1200
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,359
person trying to take everything that

1201
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,920
I've worked my butt off for for the last

1202
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,800
30 years. And what does that look like?

1203
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:36,000
and how long is this going to last

1204
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:39,280
before the judge decides this is my

1205
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,040
final judgment? So everything about my

1206
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:45,280
last divorce took 4 and 1/2 years. I

1207
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,640
lost all of my appeals in the lower

1208
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:52,319
courts. Then I lost all of my appeals in

1209
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:55,599
the Supreme Courts. And so I had like

1210
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:59,200
three weeks to cough up almost $1.2

1211
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,119
million that I did not have to give.

1212
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,800
And then who do I turn to,

1213
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,520
>> right?

1214
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,319
>> When I'm financially

1215
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,760
depleted,

1216
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,880
>> right?

1217
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,800
>> I was doing all right financially until

1218
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,200
this divorce turned in the 4 and 1/2

1219
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,720
years.

1220
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,440
>> I got this calculator in my head that's

1221
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:23,359
adding up all the trauma we have talked

1222
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:26,640
about and it's it's smoking.

1223
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:29,760
It's smoking. The batteries are burning

1224
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,240
from from uh the experience you went

1225
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,040
through with your mother

1226
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,319
to the death of your father

1227
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,599
to the crisis of three relationships

1228
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,880
[snorts] to trying to figure out how to

1229
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,680
raise a daughter.

1230
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,119
>> Two daughters,

1231
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,000
>> two daughters while you're trying to

1232
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,000
heal your yourself.

1233
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,240
How how do you cope with feeling and

1234
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,680
everybody having an opinion about all

1235
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,920
the stuff you're doing? You're crying on

1236
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,920
the internet and everybody's making fun

1237
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,920
and

1238
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,240
how do you cope with being

1239
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,240
misunderstood?

1240
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,119
Um,

1241
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,119
I've gotten comfortable with being

1242
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,119
misunderstood

1243
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,400
and I've been the beneficiary

1244
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,000
of being misunderstood

1245
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,920
because when people don't understand

1246
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,680
you, they want to stay away from you.

1247
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,079
>> Okay?

1248
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,760
>> Oh, he weird. He this, he that. Oh,

1249
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,359
thank you.

1250
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,160
Um, I would rather be at dinner for 3

1251
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:40,880
hours for Bishop G TD Jake.

1252
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:44,720
>> Uh, because at this point I value my

1253
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,359
time. I value my mental health. I value

1254
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,079
the people that I allow in my space.

1255
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,680
>> Mhm.

1256
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:54,720
>> And so I have this very simple saying.

1257
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,760
If I do a lunch or a dinner with you and

1258
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,160
I leave the same person that I showed up

1259
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,000
as,

1260
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,079
give me my three hours back.

1261
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,680
>> Yeah.

1262
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:11,200
>> My goal in life at this point is to

1263
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:15,280
become very intentional about who I

1264
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:18,960
allow in my personal space, who I who I

1265
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,720
allow myself to exchange with. Um, and

1266
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,520
this is not money. This is not about

1267
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:26,640
like, you know, everything about who I

1268
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,400
spend time with has to be connected to a

1269
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:32,240
mission. How we going to get to the

1270
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,480
money? No. Because most of the most

1271
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:38,640
life-changing moments and exchanges that

1272
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,559
I've had over my 46 years

1273
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,319
has nothing to do with having

1274
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,720
conversations about how to get to the

1275
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,839
money.

1276
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,079
>> Mhm.

1277
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:49,520
>> You know, I don't know what I don't

1278
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:52,400
know. And I am afraid at this point of

1279
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,960
what I don't know. I need somebody to

1280
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,280
love me into a better me. Give me the

1281
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,480
heads up of what's around the corner.

1282
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,559
Talk to me in great detail about the

1283
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,400
choices and the mistakes, the

1284
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,760
shortcomings, the things that you were

1285
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,160
blindsided by. the the the charm, the

1286
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,040
charisma, the undiscovered magicians

1287
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,119
that know how to create all the smoke

1288
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,599
>> and get you to think and believe that

1289
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:20,160
they are what they appear to be. And

1290
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,640
then when the smoke clears, this is what

1291
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,720
their intentions were.

1292
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:29,599
Love me in a way that's connected to

1293
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,280
protecting me because I'm tired of

1294
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,760
crying.

1295
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:37,040
I'm tired of coming close to losing it

1296
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:42,480
all. I'm tired of living and being on

1297
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:46,160
edge. I'm tired of I'm afraid of what I

1298
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,599
don't know. And who's going to love me

1299
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:53,280
enough? Who's going to make me a choice

1300
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,040
and say, "Let me love you to protect you

1301
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,920
from all the things that you don't

1302
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,839
know."

1303
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,040
>> Chapter number seven deals with life

1304
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,640
after divorce. It deals with current

1305
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,160
relationships.

1306
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,200
So, if you didn't have a point of

1307
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:11,200
reference at home in the arms of a

1308
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,960
mother or sitting on the lap of a father

1309
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,359
and you didn't have a point of reference

1310
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,280
in the three relationships, not saying

1311
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:20,319
it's their fault, but it didn't work

1312
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:23,119
out. What's different about this one

1313
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:26,880
that gives you the hope

1314
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,800
of of finding the love that little boy?

1315
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,680
I'm not talking about the grown man, the

1316
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,640
actor who's fast, driving fast and

1317
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:39,359
furious. That

1318
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:43,599
has anybody ever loved your little boy

1319
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:46,599
and and do you think you found that

1320
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,599
person?

1321
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,880
>> What's interesting? Here's the best way

1322
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,720
I could answer that because you're

1323
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,720
speaking for a lot of men. There are a

1324
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,680
lot of men who feel the way you do.

1325
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:03,920
>> Wow.

1326
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:06,480
I um I don't know how much I could

1327
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,760
connect to the current relationship that

1328
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,160
I'm in

1329
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,160
>> and this capacity.

1330
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:21,040
I'm actually s surprised and shocked

1331
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,559
that my relationship had lasted this

1332
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:27,040
long because

1333
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,280
it started with flirting. Then it went

1334
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,559
into trauma bonding

1335
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,800
>> and then it became just maybe God made

1336
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:39,200
you an assignment over my life and I'm

1337
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:43,119
an assignment over yours. Um I showed up

1338
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,440
broken. She showed up broken. Um, we

1339
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,319
showed up with baggage,

1340
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,559
lots of baggage, but we made the

1341
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,720
decision that we're going to love each

1342
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,920
other enough to stand here and help each

1343
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,119
other unpack.

1344
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,559
>> Okay?

1345
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,800
>> I'm not going to judge you with the

1346
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,520
baggage that you showed up with. Don't

1347
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,200
judge me with mine. We might argue and

1348
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,599
disagree about some of the stuff that

1349
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,760
that that's pre-existing traumas that

1350
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,160
we've brought into the relationship.

1351
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,720
>> Yeah.

1352
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,200
>> Right. And so

1353
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,920
what do we do about where we are and

1354
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:20,800
what we have? And guess what? If we

1355
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:23,040
ultimately have made each other better

1356
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,839
we supposed to be in each other's life

1357
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,760
for just this period

1358
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:30,000
>> because we were here to prepare

1359
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,319
ourselves for who else is supposed to be

1360
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,520
here.

1361
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:38,880
>> Yeah. Or or did we go through all of

1362
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,280
this live unraveling?

1363
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,079
Your parenting issues, my parenting

1364
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,040
issues, relationships that have put

1365
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,040
triggers and boundaries and trauma. No,

1366
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,079
nobody ever talks to me that way. No one

1367
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,480
ever makes me feel, you know. So now I'm

1368
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:57,040
now moving and operating within the

1369
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,680
comforts and discomforts of your past

1370
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,400
experiences. I call it marrying your

1371
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,799
nurse.

1372
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:09,040
I call it marrying your nurse. The

1373
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:11,119
person that you went to to get well, you

1374
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,319
don't recognize that they're scaffolding

1375
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:17,280
and not the building. [laughter] Okay?

1376
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:20,480
And you walk off tearing up the building

1377
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,480
and living in the scaffolding and and

1378
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,599
it's hard to determine which one is

1379
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:30,240
which. Uh a lot of prayer, a lot of

1380
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:32,400
discernment. Uh, I I took every uh I

1381
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,680
took my wife to every old woman I could

1382
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,280
find,

1383
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,680
>> including my grandmother.

1384
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,839
>> Wow.

1385
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,200
>> Let the smoke because nobody knows a

1386
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,000
woman like a woman.

1387
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,400
>> Yeah.

1388
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,480
>> Nobody knows a woman like a woman. And

1389
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,359
and and there are women who have the

1390
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,599
same kind of trauma stories that you

1391
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,400
have and have been through the abuse

1392
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:54,160
that you have. And when those traumas

1393
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,359
clash,

1394
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,839
the house burns down. sometimes with the

1395
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:02,240
kids in it. So, you can't afford to

1396
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:05,520
marry the scaffolding

1397
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,920
after you build the house. Wow. Yeah.

1398
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,680
Yeah. Some people are in your life for a

1399
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,200
season.

1400
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,359
Some people are in your life for a

1401
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,200
reason. And some people are in your life

1402
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:18,640
for a lifetime. I don't know what

1403
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,319
category she fits in, but you got to

1404
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,640
figure that out. And you got to figure

1405
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,920
that out soon because

1406
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,760
you're getting older.

1407
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,799
>> Yes, sir. and you're running out of

1408
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,559
time. And I say that with a face full of

1409
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,799
gray hair [clears throat]

1410
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,040
>> that that

1411
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:37,839
if you don't figure it out quick, it

1412
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:40,880
ain't going to matter in a minute.

1413
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:42,799
>> You just said something.

1414
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,040
Some people are in your life for a

1415
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:47,119
reason. Others are there for a season.

1416
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,799
And it's important to recognize when

1417
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,079
people's seasons are over.

1418
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,720
>> Right.

1419
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:56,240
>> There's an expiration date on loyalty.

1420
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:59,200
>> Uhhuh. Some of us want to hold on

1421
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:01,760
and hold on and hold on. And you know

1422
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:04,079
that this relationship is at capacity,

1423
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,079
right? It's hit a wall. Nothing about

1424
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,280
this season that you're in right now

1425
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:11,599
makes sense to proceed with this person,

1426
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,480
but you want to hold on because you're

1427
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,359
familiar with it.

1428
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,680
>> Yeah.

1429
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,720
>> And so I've I've wrestled with all of

1430
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,920
those things. Yeah.

1431
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:24,240
>> But it all goes back to this and and I'm

1432
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,240
I'm a I'll put a button on this.

1433
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,319
Irregardless

1434
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,160
of what me all may think or believe,

1435
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,520
we've created a checklist.

1436
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,200
>> Okay.

1437
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,920
>> What she looked like.

1438
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,720
>> Uh-huh.

1439
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,319
>> The the boom boom and the cow cow and

1440
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,319
>> you know what she dressed like, what she

1441
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,559
looked like, what her net worth is. You

1442
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,280
know, women they call them a checklist.

1443
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,960
Uh-huh.

1444
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,000
>> Men have checklist, too.

1445
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,559
>> Mhm.

1446
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,480
>> And I've went into this relationship and

1447
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:02,559
I said,

1448
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:06,000
"This woman does not check off a lot of

1449
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:08,799
boxes for me." And yet for the women

1450
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,720
that I did say has the majority of those

1451
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,160
checklist,

1452
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,640
where are they at now?

1453
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,640
>> Right?

1454
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,920
>> I could not have been more wrong.

1455
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,920
>> Right?

1456
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:22,960
And so maybe God in the equation of this

1457
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,000
woman has said, "You thought you had it

1458
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,319
all figured out, but I'm going to send

1459
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,720
you something that doesn't look, doesn't

1460
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:32,960
walk, doesn't talk, doesn't have any of

1461
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,440
these things according to this checklist

1462
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,160
that I've created." Next thing you know,

1463
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:41,359
we're at 5 years and I'm with this woman

1464
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:44,400
right now in a relationship that lasted

1465
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:46,400
longer than my last marriage. Wow.

1466
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,559
Chapter number eight. You think it's

1467
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,680
just a movie or a show, but it's really

1468
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:53,440
a business. Show business. Tell me about

1469
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,680
the role you wish you'd have took that

1470
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,680
you didn't.

1471
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:04,720
TV, film, whatever, and you look back at

1472
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,720
it and say, I should have took that.

1473
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,559
Well,

1474
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,200
I I I don't really know if there's a

1475
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:14,720
role I should have took

1476
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,920
that I struggle with over the role

1477
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,359
>> that you did

1478
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,160
>> that I'm determined.

1479
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,920
>> Oh,

1480
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,720
>> to still do.

1481
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,359
>> Okay.

1482
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,799
>> The life story of Teddy Pendergrass.

1483
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:26,799
>> Okay.

1484
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,920
>> That's the movie that keeps me up at

1485
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,240
night.

1486
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,440
>> I was the Paul Bear at his funeral. I

1487
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:37,440
was I was with him for at least 6 years

1488
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:40,640
prior to him passing away. And he said,

1489
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,440
"You're the only person that could play

1490
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:46,799
me in a movie because even though you

1491
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,839
sing and you act, you never wanted to be

1492
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:53,280
me." And he's like, I would never want

1493
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:56,720
anybody to play a role of me as Teddy

1494
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,880
Pendergrass who groomed and nurtured and

1495
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,599
tried to sound like me, look like me,

1496
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,599
perform like me. You were you the whole

1497
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,960
time and that's why I want you to play

1498
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,079
me in the movie.

1499
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,000
>> So Lee Daniels is attached to directed

1500
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,760
because him and Teddy are both from

1501
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,720
Philadelphia.

1502
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,200
And [snorts]

1503
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,960
so, you know, it's it's in a gray area

1504
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,839
right now. There's some stuff that's

1505
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:23,119
going on creatively that's kind of put

1506
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:27,040
the project on hold. But I hope and I

1507
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:29,839
pray that I'm able to keep my word that

1508
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,480
I gave him that I'm going to tell his

1509
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:33,359
story.

1510
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,480
>> What kind of man was Teddy Pendergrass?

1511
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,240
>> He was a good man.

1512
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,119
>> I grew up my brother used to have these

1513
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,960
eight tracks with Teddy Pendergrass on

1514
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,319
them and he would turn them up all the

1515
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,480
way to 10. Yes, sir.

1516
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:46,160
>> And play them. And he was the man.

1517
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,680
>> Yes, sir. famous incidentally for

1518
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,799
wearing white suits and you got on a

1519
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,920
white jacket and and he he performed

1520
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,920
>> with his cowboy hat.

1521
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,920
>> Yeah. When I met him, he was in a

1522
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,640
wheelchair doing gospel plays.

1523
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:02,680
>> Yeah.

1524
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:02,680
>> Uh you you watched his deterioration.

1525
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:08,302
There's nothing like deterioration to

1526
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,880
show your inner ingredients. M

1527
01:02:08,302 --> 01:02:12,240
[clears throat]

1528
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,240
>> in in a word or two without divulging

1529
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,839
anything private or personal,

1530
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:21,839
>> what kind of man was he?

1531
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:24,839
>> Charm. Charming. Charismatic.

1532
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,839
Um,

1533
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
you know, I I've been around my share of

1534
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,799
people,

1535
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,240
>> right,

1536
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:37,440
>> that are in a wheelchair,

1537
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,040
uh, or living with some type of terminal

1538
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,920
illness.

1539
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,599
And you'd be surprised at how often they

1540
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,160
go out of their way to make sure that

1541
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,040
nobody feels sorry for them.

1542
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,200
>> Right. Right.

1543
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,040
>> And Teddy was that guy. Don't feel sorry

1544
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,880
for me. What's going on? How you doing?

1545
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,079
Oh, yeah. you know, whatever you going

1546
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,640
through. I mean, you ain't going through

1547
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,280
this,

1548
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,799
>> right?

1549
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,720
>> You know, so he'll be the one to give

1550
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:01,119
you some perspective while he's laying

1551
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,240
in the bed quadripollesgic, paralyzed

1552
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,799
from the neck down,

1553
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,400
>> right?

1554
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:06,240
>> And then you leave there and you go,

1555
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,640
"Well, yeah, you know, he he gave me

1556
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,480
some perspective that I did not have,

1557
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,960
but yeah, he didn't want anybody to feel

1558
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,119
sorry for him and his condition, his

1559
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,640
situation. He'll have conversations with

1560
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,200
you about it.

1561
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,663
>> But he he never wanted you to leave

1562
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,079
feeling sorry for him cuz

1563
01:03:21,663 --> 01:03:26,960
[clears throat] he found strength and

1564
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:29,119
and the choice that God kept him alive

1565
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,119
as long as he kept him alive because he

1566
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,920
could have died in that accident.

1567
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:36,640
>> There is a certain fraternity that seems

1568
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:39,839
to exist amongst talented actors,

1569
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,319
singers, what have you. Uh either it's a

1570
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:44,960
very good fraternity or they're beefing

1571
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:47,359
at each other. You've seem to have had a

1572
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,599
great fraternity and and and what about

1573
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:52,480
the rock? Tell me about the rock. 60

1574
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:55,119
lbs. He lost 60 lbs. I saw him on TV. I

1575
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:57,359
almost didn't recognize him.

1576
01:03:55,119 --> 01:04:01,920
Tell me about that. How number one, how

1577
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:03,920
hard is it? Uh and uh

1578
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,160
is he going to gain it back?

1579
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,520
>> I I don't I don't know anything about

1580
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:12,160
his weight loss. Uh I seen it online

1581
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,920
like everybody else. I'm not in touch

1582
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,760
with him to call him and have a

1583
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,920
conversation with him about,

1584
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,599
>> but I I it's my understanding that he

1585
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,599
lost all the weight for a movie role

1586
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,640
when he was playing a wrestler of some

1587
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,760
sort.

1588
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,000
>> Um, and yeah, I'm I'm sure if he lost

1589
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,160
all that weight for the role, then he'll

1590
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,680
probably be putting it back on for his

1591
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,359
You probably don't remember this, but

1592
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,839
that's one of the first things you told

1593
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:39,359
me in California when we were going out

1594
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:41,200
to eat. How you eat sometimes and and

1595
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:43,520
gain weight and do what you got to do

1596
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,920
and then go in the gym and work it off.

1597
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:49,839
So you Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's back in

1598
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:51,839
your uh baby boy days. Yeah. Yeah. We

1599
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:53,680
ain't even we ain't even going there.

1600
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:56,079
We're going to stay out here where the

1601
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:59,520
air is fresh. Uh

1602
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:04,400
>> what was Will Smith's advice to you?

1603
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:08,400
Will Smith uh said, "You can often tell

1604
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,720
how far your life and career will go

1605
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,960
based on the five people you spend the

1606
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,559
most time with."

1607
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,319
>> Wow.

1608
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,920
>> So, if you have a problem with your

1609
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,760
life,

1610
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,079
you should have a problem with the five

1611
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,200
people that you have surrounded your

1612
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:27,839
life with. If you're out of shape, you

1613
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,839
likely reflect the group of people that

1614
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:33,520
allowed for you to look that bad.

1615
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:36,000
What you're doing, what you're not

1616
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,559
doing, the direction you're going in,

1617
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,280
what direction you're not going on going

1618
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,200
in is all a reflection of the five

1619
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,839
people that you spend the most time

1620
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,440
with.

1621
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:47,760
>> That's a profound statement.

1622
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,920
>> Oh yeah. That's worth writing down

1623
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,280
>> and remembering because sometimes it is

1624
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,680
easier

1625
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,559
>> to see your brother than it is to see

1626
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,359
yourself.

1627
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,599
>> That's it.

1628
01:05:55,359 --> 01:06:00,160
>> And sometimes seeing him helps you to

1629
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,839
see yourself. I only got one more card

1630
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,105
and I I'll be done.

1631
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:06,960
>> Chapter number nine. I couldn't let

1632
01:06:04,105 --> 01:06:08,400
[music] Tyrese go without asking him.

1633
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:12,680
How's your mental health?

1634
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,680
>> How is your mental health today?

1635
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:18,160
Um,

1636
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,599
fragile.

1637
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,599
>> Okay.

1638
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,599
>> Um,

1639
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,119
I

1640
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:32,839
>> That's a terribly honest answer.

1641
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,839
>> Yeah, it it's fragile. It's fragile

1642
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,400
because

1643
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,079
I'm still

1644
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,799
processing

1645
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:46,400
my divorce. Mhm.

1646
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:51,200
>> Um I don't like where I am financially

1647
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:56,240
because of a 4 and 1/2 year legal

1648
01:06:51,200 --> 01:07:01,000
with all it's it's it's bad. Um

1649
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,000
and at the same time

1650
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:07,680
my life

1651
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:09,119
could only I I feel like

1652
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,960
h how [clears throat] could I say this?

1653
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:15,599
I I really want to encourage somebody

1654
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:18,799
with what I'm about to say. So

1655
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,640
uh think of me as a rock.

1656
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:22,960
>> Okay.

1657
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,359
>> And then there's this uh what do you

1658
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,559
call those things? The you know the the

1659
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,000
the sl Yeah.

1660
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:31,359
>> Slingshot, right? Yeah.

1661
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,119
>> So, in most cases, the slingshot is a

1662
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:36,799
stick and two things that go at the top

1663
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:39,839
and then there's a rubber band on each

1664
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:43,119
side and then the rock. So, I feel like

1665
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:46,960
my life right now, literally, I'm

1666
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:51,599
stressed. I'm on edge, anxiety, I'm

1667
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:54,799
unsure, I'm praying, I'm certain. I'm

1668
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:57,039
I'm inspired. I'm motivated. I got all I

1669
01:07:54,799 --> 01:08:02,000
got this cocktail of all of these

1670
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:05,280
different things that I am feeling

1671
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,039
and I'm the rock that's inside of this

1672
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,039
slingshot.

1673
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:16,359
And the rubber band is Jesus

1674
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:16,359
stretching me all the way back.

1675
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,440
And then when he lets go,

1676
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,839
I'm going to get thrusted

1677
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:28,159
into a level

1678
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:31,520
that I've been praying for, my heart has

1679
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:32,719
been desiring. So being stretched

1680
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,359
>> Mhm.

1681
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:36,960
>> to the level of depletion mentally,

1682
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,520
emotionally, financially,

1683
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,400
psychologically.

1684
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,719
I'm in that exact place right now.

1685
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:47,120
>> 10 years from now,

1686
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:48,560
what does success look like for you?

1687
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,839
Impact.

1688
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,759
>> Impact.

1689
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,319
>> I'm not motivated by nothing else but

1690
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:56,199
impact.

1691
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,199
>> Impact. Define it.

1692
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,159
>> Before I take my last breath,

1693
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:07,440
I have this overwhelming sense

1694
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,040
of getting all these visions and ideas

1695
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,199
out

1696
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,080
because they belong to me.

1697
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:16,080
>> Yes,

1698
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:18,719
>> they're mine. These are my assignments

1699
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,040
and I'm supposed to empty myself of all

1700
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:23,199
of these things and all of these

1701
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,960
experiences that I want to create for

1702
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:27,120
the world.

1703
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,759
And that's that's what keeps me up at

1704
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,440
night. And so I want to open a movie

1705
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,400
studio

1706
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:37,359
here in Atlanta, the one and only studio

1707
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,359
that's actually open to the public. Mhm.

1708
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:42,319
>> Um

1709
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:44,880
uh on the charitable front, I got so

1710
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:48,000
many more things that I want to do to

1711
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,759
impact the world. Um from giving and

1712
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,359
nothing temporary, something that's

1713
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:54,880
going to be in place. I I want to put

1714
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,760
trades

1715
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,800
uh in place for for prison inmates when

1716
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,960
they get out. teach them a trade so that

1717
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,320
so so that the concept of them winging

1718
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:09,840
it once they get out. Um because there's

1719
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:12,560
so many of us that are capable of doing

1720
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:15,199
it but we just don't have any trades.

1721
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,760
Like teach me something that's connected

1722
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:20,320
to how I can survive. So as the market

1723
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,080
continues to go up and down, I'm I'm

1724
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:26,000
something that's self-sufficient and

1725
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:30,320
independent of a Bitcoin. Our re-entry

1726
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:32,560
program has seen over 40,000 formerly

1727
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,320
incarcerated people go through our

1728
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,840
programs. Most of which who came out

1729
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:40,480
with jobs, had their records expuned,

1730
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,239
did family reunification,

1731
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,480
anger management, everything was

1732
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:47,440
necessary to keep them from going back.

1733
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,840
The rate of recetivism is amazing. One

1734
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:52,400
of the best in the country. uh because

1735
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:55,280
we took the time to walk them through a

1736
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:57,360
two-year process to help them to

1737
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,600
acclimate. One of them, I was talking to

1738
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,760
one of them myself. Yeah. Yeah. You're

1739
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,679
talking to the right guy.

1740
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,360
I was talking to one of them and and he

1741
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:08,560
says, "Show me how to use a phone

1742
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,000
>> because [clears throat] when he went in,

1743
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,719
we had payoneses.

1744
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,760
>> When he came out, we had Apple phones."

1745
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:19,360
>> You know, uh there's so many simple

1746
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:21,280
things. when when he went in uh he was

1747
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,360
married. When he came out, he was

1748
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,719
divorced and she was remarried. When he

1749
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,960
went in, uh the the world was totally

1750
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,199
different. You know, we were busing and

1751
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:34,239
training. When he came out, we were

1752
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:36,400
flying and now our cars are being driven

1753
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,840
without people in them. The world is

1754
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,560
changing so fast.

1755
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,040
>> So fast.

1756
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:44,679
>> In the midst of the change, I want to

1757
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,679
say this to you.

1758
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,760
I pray you find

1759
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:52,800
everything

1760
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,320
that God has for you that gives you

1761
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,719
peace,

1762
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,400
that gives you joy, that gives you

1763
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:01,040
wholeness,

1764
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,000
that gives you mental health,

1765
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:08,320
that gives you peace,

1766
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,640
that makes you dance in the rain.

1767
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,480
The kind of happy

1768
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:18,080
that not a scene in a movie,

1769
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:22,199
just a happy man dancing in the rain.

1770
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,199
Thank you for this time together.

1771
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,480
in it. I really mean that for you.

1772
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,840
>> Thank you, sir.

1773
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,800
>> I really want you to have that.

1774
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,600
>> Thank you, sir.

1775
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:43,920
>> That was amazing.

1776
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,800
That was amazing. That was powerful.

1777
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,040
>> Thank you, sir.

1778
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,920
>> That was powerful. And it was real.

1779
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,480
It was real.

1780
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:56,160
>> My honor, sir.

1781
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,160
>> Give me a hug. Yeah. [laughter]

1782
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,080
>> Thank you.

1783
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:03,040
I hope you got something out of me.

1784
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:06,159
>> Oh yeah. Beyond life my my life changed.

1785
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,159
>> You spoke for so many men.

1786
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:10,080
>> Hey everybody, I want to take this time
