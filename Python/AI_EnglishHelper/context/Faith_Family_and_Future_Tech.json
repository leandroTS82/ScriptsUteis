  "final_story": "On a rainy Thursday, the Johnson family gathered around a sleek smart speaker in the living room. Their father, an engineer, had spent the last week building a small robot that could help with chores—“just to keep the kids busy while we pray,” he said, smiling at his wife and two kids.\n\nWhen the robot finally whirred to life, the youngest, Lily, squealed. “I’m so glad!” she exclaimed. “It’s like a little helper from the future!”\n\nTheir mother, a devout woman, nodded and whispered, “This is a blessing. We’re using technology to ease our burdens, so we can focus more on faith, family, and each other.”\n\nThe father turned to Lily and asked, “And you?” He meant to invite her to share her feelings. Lily grinned and answered, “I want to learn to program so I can help build more helpful things for our family.”\n\nTogether, they set a goal: the robot would clean up after dinner for that purpose, freeing up the family to share stories, sing songs, and read a passage from the Bible. Each evening, after dinner, they would gather around the table, the robot humming in the corner, and talk about how technology could be a tool for love, not a distraction.\n\nIn the glow of the screen, the Johnsons felt their faith strengthened by the evidence that caring and curiosity could coexist. Their hearts were full of gratitude, and their smiles were bright. The family’s faith in each other and in the future had never felt so hopeful.",
