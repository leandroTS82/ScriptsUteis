  "final_story": "\"stop rehearsing,\" whispered Maya to her son as he stared at the screen. He had been rehearsing his prayer recitation for the family video call, but Maya believed that faith is more than repetition. She told him, \"Start responding.\"\n\nThey had recently adopted the new AI assistant to connect their family across the city. Instead of just practicing the lines, they let the assistant ask spontaneous questions. The child answered with a genuine heart, his words echoing the family's faith. He was even smiling as the robot listened.\n\nEven though the technology was new, the family trusted it would bring them closer. even though their grandparents lived in a quiet town, the video call made them feel the same love as if they were side by side. instead of just practicing, the grandson answered from his heart, and the screen shimmered with laughter.",
