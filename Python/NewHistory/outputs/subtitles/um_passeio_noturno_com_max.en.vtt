It was nighttime. He went out to walk his dog. His dog was big. The dog's name was Max.

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:11.040
Let's go, Max. He said to his dog. He walked past his neighbor's house. He saw there were no lights

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.160
in the house. His neighbor was not home. He walked past the market. There were people shopping for

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.080
groceries. He remembered he needed milk. He tied Max to a pole. Wait here, Max. He said,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.160
he walked inside the market. It took 15 minutes to buy the milk. He untied Max and continued walking.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.840
He walked back to his house. He let Max inside the house. It was time to feed Max. He served Max

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.759
a bowl of dog food. Max ate it quickly. It was late. He took Max to the backyard. Max slept in a

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:49.759
doghouse. He said goodnight to Max. Max parked.
